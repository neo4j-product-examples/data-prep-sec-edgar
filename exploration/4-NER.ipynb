    "## 2. Labeling Nodes\n",
    "- **Consistency**: Ensure you use basic or elementary types for node labels.\n",
    "  - For example, when you identify an entity representing a person, always label it as **\"person\"**. Avoid using more specific terms like \"mathematician\" or \"scientist\".\n",

Any decline in that industry could adversely affect our future revenue and profitability.\\nWe estimate that customers in the AEC/O industry accounted for more than 50% of our net sales in 2021; therefore, our results largely depend on the strength of that industry.

A downturn in the AEC/O industry would diminish demand for all of our products and services, and would therefore negatively affect our revenues and have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\\nWe derive a significant percentage of net sales from within the State of California and our business could be disproportionately harmed by an economic downturn or natural disaster affecting California.', metadata={'source': 'https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1305168/000130516822000027/0001305168-22-000027-index.htm', 'documentId': '0001305168-22-000027-item1a-chunk0002'}),\n Document(page_content='We derived approximately 33% of our net sales in 2021 from our operations in California.

Our efforts will be affected by our ability to acquire new customers for our new service offerings as well as sell the new service offerings to existing customers. If we fail to procure new customers or sell these services to our existing customers, our growth may be adversely affected and we may incur operating losses as a result of a failure to realize revenue from the investments made in new service offerings.\\nBecause a significant portion of our overall costs are fixed, our earnings are highly sensitive to changes in revenue.', metadata={'source': 'https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1305168/000130516822000027/0001305168-22-000027-index.htm', 'documentId': '0001305168-22-000027-item1a-chunk0003'}),\n Document(page_content='Because a significant portion of our overall costs are fixed, our earnings are highly sensitive to changes in revenue.\\nOur network of service centers, equipment and related support activities involves substantial fixed costs which cannot be adjusted quickly to respond to declines in demand for our services.

We provide digital printing and document-related services to customers in a growing variety of industries. Our primary services are:\\n•\\ndigital printing of general and specialized business documents such as those found in marketing and advertising, engineering and construction and other industries, as well as producing highly-customized display graphics of all types and sizes;\\n•\\nacquiring, placing and managing ARC-certified office printing equipment with proprietary device tracking and print management software at our customers’ offices and job sites;\\n•\\nscanning documents, indexing them and adding digital search features for use in digital document management, document archives and facilities management, as well as providing other digital imaging services; and,\\n•\\nreselling digital printing equipment and supplies.\\nEach of these services frequently include additional logistics services in the form of distributing and delivering finished documents, installing display graphics, or the digital storage of graphic files. \\nFor a more complete description of our business, and product and service offerings, see Part I, Item 1 - \"Business\" - of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\\nCosts and Expenses', metadata={'source': 'https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1305168/000130516822000027/0001305168-22-000027-index.htm', 'documentId': '0001305168-22-000027-item7-chunk0000'}),\n Document(page_content='For a more complete description of our business, and product and service offerings, see Part I, Item 1 - \"Business\" - of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\\nCosts and Expenses\\n \\nOur cost of sales consists primarily of materials (paper, toner and other consumables), labor, and “indirect costs.” Indirect costs consist primarily of equipment expenses related to our MPS locations (typically our customers’ offices and job sites) and our service centers. Facilities and equipment expenses include maintenance, repairs, rents, insurance, and depreciation. Paper is the largest component of our material cost; however, paper pricing typically does not significantly affect our operating margins as they are often passed on to our customers. We closely monitor material cost as a percentage of net sales to measure volume and waste, and we maintain low levels of inventory. We also track labor utilization, or net sales per employee, to measure productivity and determine staffing levels.\\nHistorically, our capital expenditure requirements have varied based on our need for printing equipment in our MPS locations and service centers. Over the past two years, the pandemic has reduced the number of employees in our customers’ locations, which has, in turn, reduced the need for equipment. We believe this equipment trend is likely to become permanent and, as a result, we think the past two years are more indicative of future capital needs than historical trends. \\nBecause our relationships with credit providers allow us to obtain attractive lease rates, we chose to lease rather than purchase most of our equipment over the past two years.\\nResearch and development costs consist mainly of the salaries, leased building space, and computer equipment related to our data storage and development centers in San Ramon, California and Kolkata, India. Such costs are primarily recorded to cost of sales.\\nCOVID-19 Pandemic', metadata={'source': 'https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1305168/000130516822000027/0001305168-22-000027-index.htm', 'documentId': '0001305168-22-000027-item7-chunk0001'}),\n Document(page_content='COVID-19 Pandemic\\nThe COVID-19 pandemic continued to have adverse effects on our financial performance during 2021, but barring further negative developments of the virus and its impact on personal and economic well-being, we expect that the worst of those effects are behind us. The effects of its economic disruption continued to be felt throughout the first quarter of 2021. As such, our first quarter performance was the weakest of the year. Business momentum from that point forward, however, increased throughout the remainder of the year. The relationships we developed with new customers and in new markets during the worst of the pandemic in 2020 began to normalize in 2021 as the products and services we provided shifted from serving health and safety needs to serving the needs of our clients’ economic objectives.  Our MPS business remained under pressure throughout the year as work-from-home policies remained firmly in place. We expect a hybrid office to remain the norm in 2022, but for print volumes to increase marginally as employers bring their employees back into the office at higher rates than we saw in 2021. We believe work-from-home practices benefit our scanning business as employees need access to documents, regardless of where they are working, and document scanning is the first step in making them accessible in the cloud. \\n16', metadata={'source': 'https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1305168/000130516822000027/0001305168-22-000027-index.htm', 'documentId': '0001305168-22-000027-item7-chunk0002'}),\n Document(page_content='16\\nUncertainty continues around the potential disruption to our business related to the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the pandemic’s overall impact on the U.S. economy, on our clients’ ongoing business operations, and on our results of operations and financial condition. While our management team is actively monitoring the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and may take further voluntary or required actions to alter our business operations to protect employees and customers, the full impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operational results, financial condition, or liquidity for the future cannot be estimated at this point. The following discussions are subject to the future effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on our ongoing business operations.\\nEmployee Safety\\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented significant changes to our operating environment to help our employees around the world remain safe. Most of our corporate, financial and administrative staff have been working entirely or partially from home, while our service center staff continues to work in our facilities and adhere to strict safety and health protocols.\\nWe reconfigured our service center production and other high-traffic areas to ensure sufficient distancing, installed clear barriers at our customer counters and other high-density areas, limited visitor entry where appropriate, and dramatically increased virtual meetings in place of face-to-face meetings.\\nMarket Review\\nWe believe the expanding list of industries we serve are generally growing and offer ongoing sales opportunities for our services.', metadata={'source': 'https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1305168/000130516822000027/0001305168-22-000027-index.htm', 'documentId': '0001305168-22-000027-item7-chunk0003'}),\n Document(page_content='Market Review\\nWe believe the expanding list of industries we serve are generally growing and offer ongoing sales opportunities for our services. \\nDemand for digital printing appears high across our customer base, and includes environmental graphics, marketing and promotional work. We believe the incorporation of hybrid work schedules and return-to-office initiatives across the economy due to the pandemic continue to create opportunities for our MPS services and software, and that work-from-home and other remote document access requirements are spurring demand for scanning and digital imaging services.\\nWe believe that the desire to communicate visually—and especially in color—is growing in all areas of commerce, in office environments, in educational venues, and in public spaces of all kinds. While office capacity has fluctuated with the progress of the COVID-19 pandemic, we believe there is minimal desire to abandon offices. We believe employers want to make environments more inviting and engaging for the people who occupy them. \\nConstruction activity has been remarkably robust over the past year. While constrained by labor and supply chain issues, we think building activity for both new buildings and retrofitting older structures continues to be driven by property developers and owners who are intent on keeping their real estate assets compelling to tenants and prospective tenants. \\nWe don’t believe economic inflation in the U.S., Canada and abroad has materially affected our business over the past year. Price increases in materials are typically passed on to our customers. Similarly, supply chain disruptions over the past year have been minimal, primarily because of the wide variety of suppliers we have developed over our history.\\n\\xa0\\n17\\nResults of Operations\\n2021 Versus 2020\\n\\xa0\\nYear Ended December 31,\\nIncrease\\xa0(decrease)\\n(In millions, except percentages)\\n2021 \\n(1)\\n2020 \\n(1)\\n$ \\n(1)\\n%\\nDigital Printing\\n$\\n166.7\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n175.5\\xa0\\n$\\n(8.8)\\n(5.0)\\n%\\nMPS\\n72.4\\n\\xa0\\n79.3\\xa0\\n(6.9)\\n(8.7)\\n%', metadata={'source': 'https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1305168/000130516822000027/0001305168-22-000027-index.htm', 'documentId': '0001305168-22-000027-item7-chunk0004'}),\n Document(page_content='Year Ended December 31,\\nIncrease\\xa0(decrease)\\n(In millions, except percentages)\\n2021 \\n(1)\\n2020 \\n(1)\\n$ \\n(1)\\n%\\nDigital Printing\\n$\\n166.7\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n175.5\\xa0\\n$\\n(8.8)\\n(5.0)\\n%\\nMPS\\n72.4\\n\\xa0\\n79.3\\xa0\\n(6.9)\\n(8.7)\\n%\\nScanning and Digital Imaging\\n14.5\\n\\xa0\\n12.3\\xa0\\n2.2\\n\\xa0\\n17.5\\n\\xa0\\n%\\nTotal services sales\\n$\\n253.6\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n267.2\\xa0\\n$\\n(13.6)\\n(5.1)\\n%\\nEquipment and Supplies sales\\n18.6\\n\\xa0\\n22.3\\xa0\\n(3.7)\\n(16.5)\\n%\\nTotal net sales\\n$\\n272.2\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n289.5\\xa0\\n$\\n(17.3)\\n(6.0)\\n%\\nGross profit\\n$\\n87.7\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n92.9\\xa0\\n$\\n(5.3)\\n(5.7)\\n%\\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\\n$\\n72.3\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n79.0\\xa0\\n$\\n(6.7)\\n(8.5)\\n%\\nAmortization of intangibles\\n$\\n0.2\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n1.5\\xa0\\n$\\n(1.3)\\n(86.7)\\n%\\nInterest expense, net\\n$\\n2.1\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n3.9\\xa0\\n$\\n(1.8)\\n(45.1)\\n%\\nIncome tax provision \\n$\\n4.2\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n2.7\\xa0\\n$\\n1.4\\n\\xa0\\n52.1\\n\\xa0\\n%\\nNet income attributable to ARC\\n$\\n9.1\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n6.2\\xa0\\n$\\n3.0\\n\\xa0\\n47.8\\n\\xa0\\n%\\nAdjusted net\\xa0income attributable to ARC\\n (2)\\n$\\n9.5\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n6.3\\xa0\\n$\\n3.2\\n\\xa0\\n50.6\\n\\xa0\\n%\\nCash flows provided by operating activities\\n$\\n35.8\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n54.5\\xa0\\n$\\n(18.7)\\n(34.3)\\n%\\nEBITDA \\n(2)\\n$\\n40.0\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n43.2\\xa0\\n$\\n(3.2)\\n(7.4)\\n%\\nAdjusted EBITDA \\n(2)\\n$\\n41.7\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n44.8\\xa0\\n$\\n(3.1)\\n(6.8)\\n%\\n(1)\\nColumn does not foot due to rounding.\\n(2)\\nSee \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" following \"Results of Operations\" for definitions, reconciliations and more information related to our Non-GAAP disclosures.\\nThe following table provides information on the percentages of certain items of selected financial data as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated:\\n\\xa0\\nAs\\xa0Percentage\\xa0of\\xa0Net\\xa0Sales\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n\\xa0\\n2021 \\n(1)\\n2020 \\n(1)\\nNet Sales\\n100.0\\n\\xa0\\n%\\n100.0\\xa0\\n%\\nCost of sales\\n67.8\\n\\xa0\\n67.9\\xa0\\nGross profit\\n32.2\\n\\xa0\\n32.1\\xa0\\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\\n26.6\\n\\xa0\\n27.3\\xa0\\nAmortization of intangibles\\n0.1\\n\\xa0\\n0.5\\xa0\\nIncome from operations\\n5.6\\n\\xa0\\n4.3\\xa0\\nInterest expense, net\\n0.8\\n\\xa0\\n1.4\\xa0\\nIncome before income tax provision\\n4.8\\n\\xa0\\n3.0\\xa0\\nIncome tax provision\\n1.5\\n\\xa0\\n0.9\\xa0\\nNet income \\n3.2\\n\\xa0\\n2.0\\xa0\\nLoss attributable to the noncontrolling interest\\n0.1\\n\\xa0\\n0.1\\xa0\\nNet income attributable to ARC\\n3.4\\n\\xa0\\n%\\n2.1\\xa0\\n%\\nEBITDA \\n(2)\\n14.7\\n\\xa0\\n%\\n14.9\\xa0\\n%\\nAdjusted EBITDA \\n(2)\\n15.3\\n\\xa0\\n%\\n15.5\\xa0\\n%\\n\\xa0\\n(1)', metadata={'source': 'https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1305168/000130516822000027/0001305168-22-000027-index.htm', 'documentId': '0001305168-22-000027-item7-chunk0005'}),\n Document(page_content='3.2\\n\\xa0\\n2.0\\xa0\\nLoss attributable to the noncontrolling interest\\n0.1\\n\\xa0\\n0.1\\xa0\\nNet income attributable to ARC\\n3.4\\n\\xa0\\n%\\n2.1\\xa0\\n%\\nEBITDA \\n(2)\\n14.7\\n\\xa0\\n%\\n14.9\\xa0\\n%\\nAdjusted EBITDA \\n(2)\\n15.3\\n\\xa0\\n%\\n15.5\\xa0\\n%\\n\\xa0\\n(1)\\nColumn does not foot due to rounding.\\n(2)\\nSee \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" following \"Results of Operations\" for definitions, reconciliations and more information related to our Non-GAAP disclosures.\\n18\\nFiscal Year Ended December\\xa031, 2021 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended December\\xa031, 2020 \\nNet Sales\\nNet sales in 2021 decreased 6.0%, compared to 2020. The decrease in net sales was driven largely by the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic during the first quarter of 2021, offset by year-over-year quarterly net sales growth in the remaining quarters of the year.\\nDigital Printing\\n.\\n Sales of Digital Printing services in 2021 decreased by $8.8 million, or 5.0%, compared to 2020. The decrease in sales of Digital Printing services was primarily due to the $11.7 million year-over-year drop during the first quarter of 2021 resulting from the economic slowdown caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Digital Printing services represented\\xa061%  of total net sales for both 2021 and 2020. \\nMPS\\n.\\n Sales of MPS services in 2021 decreased by $6.9 million, or 8.7%, compared to 2020. The decline in annual MPS sales was driven primarily by sales decreases in the first quarter of 2021 as office employees in the U.S. and Canada followed employer directives to work from home, significantly reducing the volume of printing done in our customers’ offices. MPS sales grew year-over-year in the three subsequent quarters of 2021 as work-from-home directives eased as the year progressed. MPS engagements on construction job sites operated throughout the year as construction activity remained robust. Revenues from MPS sales represented approximately 27% of total net sales for both 2021 and 2020.\\nThe number of MPS locations have remained relatively flat year-over-year at approximately 10,780 as of December\\xa031, 2021.', metadata={'source': 'https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1305168/000130516822000027/0001305168-22-000027-index.htm', 'documentId': '0001305168-22-000027-item7-chunk0006'}),\n Document(page_content='The number of MPS locations have remained relatively flat year-over-year at approximately 10,780 as of December\\xa031, 2021.\\nScanning and Digital Imaging\\n.\\n Year-over-year sales of Scanning and Digital Imaging services increased by $2.2 million, or 17.5%, in 2021, compared to 2020. The increase in sales of our Scanning and Digital Imaging services was primarily attributable to the end of work-from-home directives for some of our customers, resulting in greater demand for our scanning services. We continue to drive an expansion of our addressable market for Scanning and Digital Imaging services with increased marketing activity, as well as targeting building owners and facility managers that require on-demand access to their legacy documents to operate their assets efficiently. We believe that, with the expansion of the markets and industries we serve and the desire of our existing customers to have digital access to documents, our Scanning and Digital Imaging services will continue to grow in the future. \\nEquipment and Supplies\\n.\\n Equipment and Supplies sales decreased by $3.7 million, or 16.5%, in 2021, compared to 2020. The decrease was primarily driven by the economic slowdown in China related to the COVID-19 pandemic, which decreased sales from UNIS Document Solutions Co. Ltd, or UDS, our Chinese joint venture. Equipment and Supplies sales derived from UDS, were $3.9 million in 2021, as compared to $7.7 million in 2020.

Gross margin increased to 32.2% in 2021, compared to 32.1% in 2020, despite a net sales decrease of $17.3 million. Gross margin improvement was largely driven by the new cost structure we put in place in 2020, and through our efforts to drive more work through our service centers to leverage our infrastructure, cross-trained workforce, and production-grade equipment. \\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\\nSelling, general and administrative expenses decreased by $6.7 million, or 8.5%, in 2021 compared to 2020. The reduction was primarily due to permanent cost saving activities from the cost structure we put in place in 2020, which included headcount reductions among other things.\\nAmortization of Intangibles\\nAmortization of intangibles of $0.2 million in 2021 decreased compared to 2020, primarily due to the completed amortization of certain customer relationships related to historical acquisitions.

Determining the fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental in nature and requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including revenue growth rates and EBITDA margins, discount rates and future market conditions, among others. The level of judgement and estimation is inherently higher in the current environment considering the uncertainty created by the COVID-19 pandemic. We have evaluated numerous factors disrupting our business and made significant assumptions which include the severity and duration of our business disruption, the timing and degree of economic recovery and ultimately, the combined effect of these assumptions on our future operating results and cash flows. \\nThe results of the latest annual goodwill impairment test, as of September 30, 2021, were as follows:\\n(Dollars in thousands)\\nNumber\\xa0of\\nReporting\\nUnits\\nRepresenting\\nGoodwill of\\nNo goodwill balance\\n6\\xa0\\n$\\n—\\xa0\\nFair value of reporting units exceeds their carrying values by more than 100%\\n2\\xa0\\n121,051\\xa0\\n8\\xa0\\n$\\n121,051', metadata={'source': 'https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1305168/000130516822000027/0001305168-22-000027-index.htm', 'documentId': '0001305168-22-000027-item7-chunk0026'}),\n Document(page_content='Number\\xa0of\\nReporting\\nUnits\\nRepresenting\\nGoodwill of\\nNo goodwill balance\\n6\\xa0\\n$\\n—\\xa0\\nFair value of reporting units exceeds their carrying values by more than 100%\\n2\\xa0\\n121,051\\xa0\\n8\\xa0\\n$\\n121,051\\xa0\\nBased upon a sensitivity analysis, a reduction of approximately 50 basis points of projected EBITDA in 2022 and beyond, assuming all other assumptions remain constant, would result in no further impairment of goodwill.\\nBased upon a separate sensitivity analysis, a 50 basis point increase to the weighted average cost of capital would result in no further impairment of goodwill.\\nGiven the uncertainty regarding the ultimate financial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the proceeding economic recovery, and the changing document and printing needs of our customers and the uncertainties regarding the effect on our business, there can be no assurance that the estimates and assumptions made for purposes of our goodwill impairment testing in 2021 will prove to be accurate predictions of the future. If our assumptions, including forecasted EBITDA of certain reporting units, are not achieved, or our assumptions change regarding disruptions caused by the pandemic, and the impact on the recovery from COVID-19 change, then we may be required to record goodwill impairment charges in future periods, whether in connection with our next annual impairment testing in the third quarter of 2022, or on an interim basis, if any such change constitutes a triggering event (as defined under ASC 350, \\nIntangibles - Goodwill and Other\\n) outside of the quarter when we regularly perform our annual goodwill impairment test.

The Federal Communications Commission (the \"FCC\") regulates U.S. programming networks directly in some respects; other FCC regulations, although imposed on cable television operators and satellite operators, affect programming networks indirectly. The rules, regulations, policies and procedures affecting our businesses are constantly subject to change and increasingly, legislative and regulatory proposals seek to cover all sources of content, including the digital platforms over which we offer content, which may affect our regulatory burdens in the future. The descriptions below are summary in nature and do not purport to describe all present and proposed laws and regulations affecting our businesses.\\nClosed Captioning\\nCertain of our networks must provide closed-captioning of programming for the hearing impaired, \\nand comply with other regulations designed to make our content more accessible\\n, and we must provide closed captioning on certain video content that we offer on the Internet or through other Internet Protocol distribution methods.\\nCALM Act\\nFCC rules require MVPDs to ensure that all commercials comply with specified volume standards, and our distribution agreements generally require us to certify compliance with such standards.\\nEmergency Alert Codes or Attention Signals', metadata={'source': 'https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1514991/000151499122000007/0001514991-22-000007-index.htm', 'documentId': '0001514991-22-000007-item1-chunk0024'}),\n Document(page_content=\"Emergency Alert Codes or Attention Signals\\nWe may not include emergency alert codes or attention signals, or simulations of them, in our content under any circumstances other than a genuine alert, an authorized test of the emergency alert system, or a permissible public service announcement.\\nObscenity Restrictions\\nCable operators and other MVPDs are prohibited from transmitting obscene programming, and our distribution agreements generally require us to refrain from including such programming on our networks.\\nProgram Carriage\\nThe FCC's program carriage rules prohibit distributors from favoring their affiliated programming networks over unaffiliated similarly situated programming networks in the rates, terms and conditions of carriage agreements between programming networks and cable operators or other MVPDs. Recent regulatory changes and court decisions make it more difficult for our programming networks to challenge a distributor’s decision to decline to carry one of our programming networks or discriminate against one of our programming networks.\\n15\\nPackaging Programming and Volume Discounts\\nThe FCC from time to time examines whether to adopt rules restricting how programmers package and price their networks, or whether to impose other restrictions on carriage agreements between programmers and MVPDs. We do not currently require distributors to carry more than one of our national programming networks in order to obtain the right to carry a particular national programming network. However, we generally negotiate with a distributor for the carriage of all of our national networks concurrently, and we offer volume discounts to distributors who make our programming available to larger numbers of subscribers or who carry more of our programming networks.\", metadata={'source': 'https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1514991/000151499122000007/0001514991-22-000007-index.htm', 'documentId': '0001514991-22-000007-item1-chunk0025'}),\n Document(page_content='Some states also have sought to regulate the manner in which MVPDs package and offer programming.  We generally do not allow our networks or individual programs on those networks today to be offered by distributors on an a la carte basis.\\nEffect of \"Must-Carry\" and \"Retransmission Consent\" Requirements\\nThe FCC\\'s implementation of the statutory \"must-carry\" obligations requires cable and DBS operators to give certain broadcasters preferential access to channel space and preferential channel positions, and FCC \"retransmission consent\" rules allow broadcasters to require cable and DBS operators to carry broadcast-affiliated networks as a condition of access to the local broadcast station and to charge substantial fees for both carriage of the local broadcast station and the broadcast-affiliated networks. In contrast, programming networks, such as ours, have no guaranteed right of carriage on cable television or DBS systems nor any guaranteed channel position. These carriage laws may reduce the amount of channel space that is available for carriage of our networks by cable television systems and DBS operators, or the amount of programming funds that cable and DBS operators have available for carriage of our networks.\\nWebsite Requirements\\nWe maintain various websites that provide information regarding our businesses and offer content for sale.

For example, most states have enacted laws that impose data security and security breach obligations, and new frameworks regulating consumer privacy have recently been established at the state level and overseas, including the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation, or the GDPR, and the California Consumer Privacy Act, or as amended, the CCPA. The GDPR and the CCPA impose, among other things, more stringent operational requirements for processors and controllers of personal data, including expanded disclosures about how personal information is to be used, and increased liability for violations. \\nIn addition, the FCC from time to time considers whether some or all websites offering video programming should be considered MVPDs and regulated as such.\\nOther Regulation\\nThe FCC also imposes rules that may impact us regarding a variety of issues such as advertising in children's television, and telemarketing. Programming businesses are subject to regulation by the country in which they operate, as well as international bodies, such as the European Union. These regulations may include restrictions on types of advertising that can be sold on our networks, programming content requirements, requirements to make programming available on non-discriminatory terms, and local content quotas.\\nCOMPETITION\", metadata={'source': 'https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1514991/000151499122000007/0001514991-22-000007-index.htm', 'documentId': '0001514991-22-000007-item1-chunk0027'}),\n Document(page_content=\"COMPETITION\\nOur programming services, consisting of linear networks and streaming services, operate in three highly competitive markets. First, our programming services compete with other programming services to obtain distribution on cable television systems and other multichannel video programming distribution systems, and ultimately for viewing by each distributor's subscribers. Second, our programming services compete with other programming services and other sources of video content, to secure desired entertainment programming. Third, our programming services compete with other sellers of advertising time and space, including other cable programming networks, radio, newspapers, outdoor media and, increasingly, internet sites. The success of our businesses depends on our ability to license and produce content for our programming services that is adequate in quantity and quality and will generate satisfactory viewer ratings. In each of these cases, some of our competitors are large publicly held companies that have greater financial resources than we do.\\nDistribution of Programming Services\\nThe business of distributing programming services to cable television systems and other MVPDs and licensing of original programming for distribution is highly competitive. Our programming services face competition from other programming networks and services for carriage by a particular MVPD, and for the carriage on the service tier that will attract the most subscribers. Once our programming service is selected by a distributor for carriage, that service competes for viewers not only with the other programming services available on the distributor's system, but also with over-the-air broadcast television, Internet-based video and other online services, mobile services, radio, print media, motion picture theaters, DVDs, and other sources of information and entertainment.\\n16\", metadata={'source': 'https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1514991/000151499122000007/0001514991-22-000007-index.htm', 'documentId': '0001514991-22-000007-item1-chunk0028'}),\n Document(page_content='16\\nImportant to our success in each area of competition we face are the prices we charge for our programming services, the quantity, quality and variety of the programming offered on our services, and the effectiveness of our services\\' marketing efforts. The competition for viewers among advertiser supported networks is directly correlated with the competition for advertising revenues with each of our competitors.\\nOur ability to successfully compete with other networks and services may be hampered because the cable television systems or other MVPDs through which we seek distribution may be affiliated with other programming networks or services. In addition, because such distributors may have a substantial number of subscribers, the ability of such programming services to obtain distribution on the systems of affiliated distributors may lead to increased distribution and advertising revenue for such programming networks or services because of their increased penetration compared to our programming services. Even if such affiliated distributors carry our programming services, such distributors may place their affiliated programming network on a more desirable tier, thereby giving the affiliated programming network a competitive advantage over our own.\\nNew or existing programming networks that are affiliated with broadcasting networks like ABC, CBS, Fox or NBC may also have a competitive advantage over our programming networks in obtaining distribution through the \"bundling\" of agreements to carry those programming networks with agreements giving the distributor the right to carry a broadcast station affiliated with the broadcasting network. \\nPart of our strategy involves exploiting identified segments of the cable television viewing audience that are generally well defined and limited in size.

Most of our original programming and all of our acquired programming is obtained through agreements with other parties that have produced or own the rights to such programming. Competition for this programming will increase as the number of programming networks and other distributors increases. Other programming networks or streaming services that are affiliated with programming sources such as movie or television studios or film libraries may have a competitive advantage over us in this area.\\nWith respect to the acquisition of entertainment programming, such as syndicated programs and movies that are not produced by or specifically for networks, our competitors include national broadcast television networks, local broadcast television stations, other cable programming networks, Internet-based video content distributors, and video-on-demand programs.

We compete for advertisers on the basis of rates we charge and also on the number and demographic nature of viewers who watch our programming. Advertisers will often seek to target their advertising content to those demographic categories they consider most likely to purchase the product or service they advertise. Accordingly, the demographic make-up of our viewership can be equally or more important than the number of viewers watching our programming.\\nHUMAN CAPITAL RESOURCES\\nAt AMC Networks, we are passionate about telling authentic stories that connect with audiences in meaningful ways and that entertain with vivid characters and worlds that show a full spectrum of the human experience.

It is how we understand, reflect, and speak with insight and authenticity to the wide range of audiences we reach every day. In 2021, over 50% of AMC Networks’ writers’ rooms were staffed with diverse writers.   \\nHigh Impact Partnerships\\n – We work with leading industry organizations to ensure there is greater inclusion in the stories we tell. In 2021, we signed on to #ChangeHollywood in partnership with Color of Change and others to use inclusion riders on every AMC Studios production. We are proud to be a launch partner of Coded for Inclusion, a new job matching platform for production crews designed to help change the way hiring happens in Hollywood.

Subscription fees paid by distributors represent the largest component of distribution revenue. Our subscription fee revenues for our programming networks are based on a per subscriber fee, and, to a lesser extent, fixed fees under multi-year contracts, commonly referred to as \"affiliation agreements,\" which generally provide for annual rate increases. The specific subscription fee revenues we earn vary from period to period, distributor to distributor and also vary among our programming services, but are generally based upon the number of each distributor\\'s subscribers who receive our programming, referred to as viewing subscribers.

Our arrangements with advertisers provide for a set number of advertising units to air over a specific period of time at a negotiated price per unit. Additionally, in these advertising sales arrangements, our programming networks generally guarantee specified viewer ratings for their programming. If these guaranteed viewer ratings are not met, we are generally required to provide additional advertising units to the advertiser at no charge. For these types of arrangements, a portion of the related revenue is deferred if the guaranteed ratings are not met and is subsequently recognized either when we provide the required additional advertising time or the guarantee obligation contractually expires.

In negotiating for additional subscribers or extended carriage, we have agreed, in some instances, to make upfront payments to a distributor which we record as deferred carriage fees and are amortized as a reduction to revenue over the period of the related affiliation agreement. We also may help fund the distributors\\' efforts to market our networks. We believe that these transactions generate a positive return on investment over the contract period. We seek to increase our advertising revenues by increasing the rates we charge for such advertising, which is directly related to the overall distribution of our programming, penetration of our services on various digital platforms such as Advertising Video-on-Demand (\"AVOD\") services and the popularity (including within desirable demographic groups) of our services as measured by Nielsen. \\n37', metadata={'source': 'https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1514991/000151499122000007/0001514991-22-000007-index.htm', 'documentId': '0001514991-22-000007-item7-chunk0005'}),\n Document(page_content='37\\nOur principal goal is to increase our revenues by increasing distribution and penetration of our services, and increasing our ratings. To do this, we must continue to contract for and produce high-quality, attractive programming. As competition for programming increases and alternative distribution technologies continue to emerge and develop in the industry, costs for content acquisition and original programming may increase. There is a concentration of subscribers in the hands of a few distributors, which could create disparate bargaining power between the largest distributors and us by giving those distributors greater leverage in negotiating the price and other terms of affiliation agreements. We also seek to increase our content licensing revenues by expanding the opportunities for licensing our programming through digital distribution platforms, foreign distribution and home video services. Content licensing revenues in each quarter may vary based on the timing of availability of our programming to distributors. \\nProgramming expenses, included in technical and operating expenses, represent the largest expense of the Domestic Operations segment and primarily consists of amortization and write-offs of programming rights, such as those for original programming, feature films and licensed series, as well as participation and residual costs.

These original series generally result in higher ratings for our networks. Among other things, higher audience ratings drive increased revenues through higher advertising revenues. The timing of exhibition and distribution of original programming varies from period to period, which results in greater variability in our revenues, earnings and cash flows from operating activities. We will continue to increase our investment in programming services. There may be significant changes in the level of our technical and operating expenses due to the amortization of content acquisition and/or original programming costs and/or the impact of management\\'s periodic assessment of programming usefulness. Such costs will also fluctuate with the level of revenues derived from owned original programming in each period as program rights that are monetized individually are amortized based on the individual-film-forecast-computation method, while program rights that are monetized as a group are amortized based on projected usage, typically resulting in an accelerated amortization pattern.\\nMost original series require us to make up-front investments, which are often significant amounts. Not all of our programming efforts are commercially successful, which could result in a write-off of program rights.

However, we do not expect to generate sufficient cash from operations to repay at maturity the entirety of the then outstanding balances of our debt. As a result, we will then be dependent upon our ability to access the capital and credit markets in order to repay or refinance the outstanding balances of our indebtedness. Failure to raise significant amounts of funding to repay these obligations at maturity would adversely affect our business. In such a circumstance, we would need to take other actions including selling assets, seeking strategic investments from third parties or reducing other discretionary uses of cash.

Program rights that are monetized as a group are amortized based on projected usage, typically resulting in an accelerated amortization pattern. We base our estimates of ultimate revenue primarily on distribution and advertising revenues historically generated from similar content in comparable markets, and projected program usage. Projected program usage is based on our current expectation of future exhibitions. We periodically review ultimate revenue estimates and projected program usage and revise our assumptions if necessary, which could either accelerate or delay the timing of amortization expense or result in a write-down of unamortized costs to fair value. For example, a program\\'s strong performance could result in increased usage and increased attributable revenues in a particular period, resulting in accelerated amortization of costs in that period. Poor ratings may result in the reduction of attributable revenue from planned usage or the abandonment of a program, which would require a write-off of any unamortized costs. Actual attributable revenue and exhibitions may vary from our projections due to factors such as market acceptance, levels of distribution and advertising revenue, resulting in changes to our decisions regarding planned program usage.

Further, some of the insurance products that Aflac sells in the U.S. and Japan provide cash surrender values, and a rise in interest rates could trigger significant policy surrenders, which might require the Company to sell investment assets and recognize unrealized losses. Rising interest rates also negatively impact SMR because unrealized losses on the available-for-sale investment portfolio factor into the ratio.

Further, in recent years the Company has reduced the proportion of U.S. dollar-denominated investments that are subject to a currency hedge, and this proportion continues to be subject to change at the Company’s discretion. These strategies will continue to increase the Company's exposure to U.S. interest rates, credit spreads and other risks.

Aflac Japan's premiums and a significant portion of its investment income are received in yen, and its claims and almost all expenses are paid in yen. Aflac Japan purchases yen-denominated assets and U.S. dollar-denominated assets, which may be hedged to yen, to support yen-denominated policy liabilities. Certain unhedged U.S. dollar denominated assets and liabilities held by Aflac Japan are re-measured to yen with the volatility reported in earnings. Furthermore, the yen-denominated balance sheet of Aflac Japan is translated into U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes with foreign exchange impact reflected in equity. Accordingly, fluctuations in the yen/dollar exchange rate can have a significant effect on the Company's reported financial position and results of operations. Yen weakening has the effect of suppressing current year results in relation to the prior year, while yen strengthening has the effect of magnifying current year results in relation to the prior year. In addition, the weakening of the yen relative to the U.S. dollar will generally adversely affect the value of the Company's yen-denominated investments in U.S. dollar terms. Further, unhedged U.S. dollar-denominated securities held by Aflac Japan are exposed to foreign exchange fluctuations, which impact SMR.

The exchange rates prevailing at the time of dividend payment may differ from the exchange rates prevailing at the time the yen profits were earned. The Parent Company utilizes forward contracts to accomplish a dual objective of hedging foreign currency exchange rate risk related to dividend payments by Aflac Japan, and reducing enterprise-wide hedge costs.

In addition, with respect to the Japan segment, the Company maintains a large portfolio of assets designated as held-to-maturity (HTM) as a strategy to reduce capital (solvency margin ratio or SMR) volatility. In a low interest rate environment, such as presently exists in Japan, assets designated as HTM that were purchased in a higher interest rate environment have significant embedded gains not reflected in AOCI (HTM securities are carried at amortized cost under U.S. GAAP), which serves as an economic offset to a low discount rate applied to policy liabilities. At December\\xa031, 2021, the Company’s HTM portfolio was $22.0 billion at amortized cost and had $4.9 billion in net unrealized gains. After adoption of ASU 2018-12, the Company also expects net earnings and net earnings per share (which were $4.3 billion and $6.39 per diluted share, respectively, in 2021) to reflect larger quarterly fluctuations due to the new requirement to update assumptions for liability for future policy benefits.\\nIn the near term, the expected impact on the Company’s key financial ratios is limited. Generally, benefit ratios are expected to be slightly higher as favorable experience is absorbed into reserves, while expense ratios are expected to be modestly lower due to amortizing deferred acquisition costs at a slower rate.

The Company regularly monitors its market risks and uses a variety of strategies to manage its exposure\\nto these market risks.\\nCurrency Risk\\nAflac Japan \\nThe functional currency of Aflac Japan's insurance operations is the Japanese yen. Aflac Japan’s premiums and a significant portion of its investment income are received in yen, and its claims and most expenses are paid in yen. Aflac Japan purchases yen-denominated assets and U.S. dollar-denominated assets, which may be hedged to yen, to support yen-denominated policy liabilities. These and other yen-denominated financial statement items are, however, translated into U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes. Most of Aflac Japan's cash and liabilities are yen-denominated. \\nThe Company engages in hedging activities to mitigate certain currency risks from holding U.S. dollar-denominated investments in Aflac Japan. However, this hedging program in turn poses a countervailing long-term risk of loss on hedging currency derivatives under the long-term scenario of weakening yen, and related derivative rollover risk that could amplify hedge cost in unfavorable market conditions and significantly increase liquidity requirements to support negative \\n72\\nItem 7A.

Additionally, as discussed in detail in the Risk Factors section titled “Lack of availability of acceptable yen-denominated investments could adversely affect the Company’s results of operations, financial position or liquidity,” there is a risk that losses realized on derivative settlements during periods of weakening yen may not be recouped through realization of the corresponding holding currency gains on the hedged U.S. dollar-denominated investments if these investments are not ultimately sold and converted to yen. \\nThe Company has taken steps to refine the strategy to mitigate currency exposure of Aflac Japan from U.S. dollar-denominated investments while balancing the consideration of the economic equity surplus in Aflac Japan. This refinement in strategy resulted in an increased amount of the unhedged U.S. dollar-denominated investments held in Aflac Japan while at the same time mitigating hedge cost increases. Generally\\n,\\n Aflac Japan’s exposure to the currency risk increases when its portfolio of unhedged U.S. dollar-denominated investments increases. As the value of the U.S. dollar-denominated investment portfolio in Aflac Japan fluctuates and the Company’s business model evolves, the Company periodically reevaluates this size of the unhedged portfolio and may accordingly adjust up or down its currency hedging targets.

Additionally, the Parent Company enters into forward contracts to accomplish a dual objective of hedging foreign currency rate risk to dividend payments by Aflac Japan, and reducing enterprise-wide hedge costs. The Company also balances the volume of hedging instruments between forwards and options in an attempt to manage and balance the risks associated with collateral, hedge costs and cash settlements.

For the foreign currency swaps associated with the Company's VIE investments for which it is the primary beneficiary, the Company bears the risk of foreign exchange and/or credit loss due to counterparty default even though it is not a direct counterparty to those contracts. The risk of counterparty default for the Company's VIE and senior note and subordinated debenture swaps, foreign currency swaps, certain foreign currency forwards, foreign currency options and interest rate swaptions is mitigated by collateral posting requirements that counterparties to those transactions must meet. If collateral posting agreements are not in place, the counterparty risk associated with foreign currency forwards and foreign currency options is the risk that at expiry of the contract, the counterparty is unable to deliver the agreed upon amount of yen at the agreed upon price or delivery date, thus exposing the Company to additional unhedged exposure to U.S. dollars in the Aflac Japan investment portfolio.

These principles are established primarily by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB). In these Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, references to U.S. GAAP issued by the FASB are derived from the FASB Accounting Standards Codification\\nTM\\n (ASC). The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires the Company to make estimates based on currently available information when recording transactions resulting from business operations. The most significant items on the Company's balance sheet that involve a greater degree of accounting estimates and actuarial determinations subject to changes in the future are the valuation of investments and derivatives, deferred policy acquisition costs (DAC), liabilities for future policy benefits and unpaid policy claims, and income taxes. These accounting estimates and actuarial determinations are sensitive to market conditions, investment yields, mortality, morbidity, commission and other acquisition expenses, and terminations by policyholders. As additional information becomes available, or actual amounts are determinable, the recorded estimates are revised and reflected in operating results. Although some variability is inherent in these estimates, the Company believes the amounts provided are reasonable and reflective of the best estimates of management.\\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Parent Company, its subsidiaries, and those entities required to be consolidated under applicable accounting standards. All material intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.\\n \\nCoronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19):\", metadata={'source': 'https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/4977/000000497722000058/0000004977-22-000058-index.htm', 'documentId': '0000004977-22-000058-item7a-chunk0022'}),\n Document(page_content=\"Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19): \\nThe impact of the COVID-19 global pandemic on the Company continues to evolve. Both Aflac Japan and Aflac U.S. have taken measures to address employee health and safety and increase employees’ ability to develop and maintain more flexible working conditions, with return to office undertaken as warranted by local conditions, and operations have remained stable throughout 2021. The Company continues to monitor its investment portfolios to adjust to market conditions, including the continuing recovery, changes in monetary policy and inflation. Both Aflac Japan and Aflac U.S. have accelerated investments in digital initiatives to improve productivity, efficiency and customer service over the long term. \\n91\\nItem 8.

The Company translates its yen-denominated financial statement accounts into U.S. dollars as follows. Assets and liabilities are translated at end-of-period exchange rates. Realized gains and losses on security transactions are translated at the exchange rate on the trade date of each transaction. Other revenues, expenses, and cash flows are translated using average exchange rates for the period. The resulting currency translation adjustments are reported in accumulated other comprehensive income. The Company includes in earnings the realized currency exchange gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions.\", metadata={'source': 'https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/4977/000000497722000058/0000004977-22-000058-index.htm', 'documentId': '0000004977-22-000058-item7a-chunk0023'}),\n Document(page_content=\"The Parent Company has designated a majority of its yen-denominated liabilities (notes payable and yen-denominated loans) as non-derivative hedges and from time-to-time may designate certain foreign currency forwards and options as derivative hedges of the foreign currency exposure of the Company's net investment in Aflac Japan. Outstanding principal and related accrued interest on these Parent Company liabilities and the fair value of these derivatives are translated into U.S. dollars at end-of-period exchange rates. Currency translation adjustments and changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recorded as unrealized foreign currency translation gains (losses) in other comprehensive income and are included in accumulated other comprehensive income.\\nInsurance Revenue and Expense Recognition:\\n\\u2002Substantially all of the supplemental health and life insurance policies the Company issues are classified as long-duration contracts.

A lease liability will be recorded for the obligation of a lessee to make lease payments arising from a lease. Leases will be classified as finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern and classification of expense recognition in the income statement. The Leases Update provided a number of optional practical expedients.

The measurement of expected credit losses is amended by replacing the incurred loss impairment methodology with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information. Credit losses on available-for-sale debt securities is measured in a manner similar to prior U.S. GAAP; however, the amendments require that credit losses be presented as an allowance rather than as a write-down. Other amendments include changes to the balance sheet presentation and interest income recognition of purchased financial assets with a more-than-insignificant credit deterioration since origination (PCD financial assets).\\nThis standard was adopted on January 1, 2020.

The Company anticipates that the requirement to update assumptions for liability for future policy benefits (LFPB) will have a significant impact on its results of operations, systems, processes and controls and that the requirement to update discount rates will have a significant impact on its equity.\\nAs part of working toward implementation of the updated standard, the Company has made progress on key accounting policy decisions, including processes to identify insurance policy groupings (cohorts) for LFPB measurement and DAC amortization purposes, applicable discount rates, development of liability cash flow and claim expense assumptions, and DAC amortization methodology.\\nThe Company will not early adopt the updated standard and has selected the modified retrospective transition method.

This is due to updating the LFPB discount rate assumptions from the rates locked in for reserves held as of the Transition Date to rates determined by reference to the Transition Date market level yields for upper-medium-grade (low credit risk) fixed income instruments (as of December 31, 2020).

The methodology incorporates constructing a discount rate curve separately for discounting cash flows used to calculate the U.S. and Japan LFPB, with each curve intended to be reflective of the currency, tenor and characteristics of the insurance liabilities. Discount rates comprising each curve will be determined by reference to upper-medium grade (low credit risk) fixed-income instrument yields that are intended to reflect the duration characteristics of the corresponding insurance liabilities. The Company intends to use for these yields single-A rated fixed income instruments with credit ratings based on international rating standards. Where only local ratings are available, the Company intends to select the fixed-income instruments with local ratings that are equivalent to a single-A rating based on international rating standards. The methodology will be designed to prioritize observable inputs based on market data available in the local debt markets where the respective policies were issued in the currency in which the policies are denominated. For the discount rates applicable to tenors for which the single-A debt market is not liquid or there is little or no observable market data, the Company will use various estimation techniques consistent with the fair value guidance in ASC 820, which include, but are not limited to: (i) for tenors where there is less observable market data and/or the observable market data is available for similar instruments, estimating tenor-specific single-A credit spreads and applying them to risk-free government rates; (ii) for tenors where there is very limited or no observable single-A or similar market data, interpolation and extrapolation techniques.

This includes a thorough analysis of a variety of items including the issuer's country of domicile (including political, legal, and financial considerations); the industry in which the issuer competes (with an analysis of industry structure, end-market dynamics, and regulation); company specific issues (such as management, assets, earnings, cash generation, and capital needs); and contractual provisions of the instrument (such as financial covenants and position in the capital structure).

For corporate issuers, the Company evaluates their assets, business profile including industry dynamics and competitive positioning, financial statements and other available financial data. For non-corporate issuers, the Company analyzes all sources of credit support, including issuer-specific factors. The Company utilizes information available in the public domain and, for certain private placement issuers, from consultations with the issuers directly. The Company also considers ratings from Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations (NRSROs), as well as the specific characteristics of the security it owns including seniority in the issuer's capital structure, covenant protections, or other relevant features. From these reviews, the Company evaluates the issuers' continued ability to service the Company's investment through payment of interest and principal.\\nAssuming no credit-related factors develop, unrealized gains and losses on fixed maturity securities are expected to diminish as investments near maturity. Based on its credit analysis, the Company believes that the issuers of its fixed maturity investments in the sectors shown in the table above have the ability to service their obligations to the Company, and the Company does not intend to sell the investments and it is not more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the investments before recovery of their amortized cost bases, which may be at maturity.\\nHowever, from time to time the Company identifies certain available-for-sale fixed maturity securities where the amortized cost basis exceeds the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected due to credit related factors and as a \\n111\\nItem 8.

The carrying value for middle market loans included $\\n11\\n million and $\\n25\\n million for a short term credit facility that is reflected in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets, as of December\\xa031, 2021, and 2020, respectively.\\nAs of December\\xa031, 2021, the Company had commitments of approximately $\\n1.4', metadata={'source': 'https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/4977/000000497722000058/0000004977-22-000058-index.htm', 'documentId': '0000004977-22-000058-item7a-chunk0069'}),\n Document(page_content=\"As of December\\xa031, 2021, the Company had commitments of approximately $\\n1.4\\n billion to fund future middle market loans. These commitments are contingent upon the availability of middle market loans that meet the Company's underwriting criteria.\\nCredit Quality Indicators\\nFor TREs, the Company’s key credit quality indicator is loan-to-value (LTV). Given that TRE loans involve properties undergoing renovation or construction, loan-to-value provides the most insight into the credit risk of the loan. The Company monitors the performance of the loans periodically, but not less frequently than quarterly.  \\nFor CMLs, the Company’s key credit quality indicators include LTV and debt service coverage ratios (DSCR). LTV is calculated by dividing the current outstanding loan balance by the most recent estimated property value. DSCR is the most recently available operating income of the underlying property compared to the required debt service of the loan. \\nFor MMLs and held-to-maturity fixed maturity securities, the Company’s key credit quality indicator is credit ratings. The Company’s held-to-maturity portfolio is composed of investment grade securities that are senior unsecured instruments, while its MMLs generally have below-investment-grade ratings but are typically senior secured instruments. The Company monitors the credit ratings periodically, but not less frequently than quarterly.\\nFor the Company’s reinsurance recoverable balance, the key credit quality indicator is the credit rating of the Company’s reinsurance counterparty. The Company uses external credit ratings focused on the reinsurer’s financial strength and credit worthiness. The Company's reinsurance counterparties are rated A+. The Company monitors the credit ratings periodically, but not less frequently than quarterly.\\n113\\nItem 8.

For held-to-maturity fixed maturity securities, MMLs, and MML commitments, the Company groups assets by credit ratings, industry, and country. The Company groups CMLs and TREs and respective loan commitments by property type, property location and the property’s loan-to-value and debt service coverage ratios. The credit allowance for the reinsurance recoverable balance is estimated using a probability-of-default (PD) / loss-given-default (LGD) method.\\nThe credit allowance for held-to-maturity fixed maturity securities and loan receivables is estimated using a PD / LGD method, discounted for the time value of money. For held-to-maturity fixed maturity securities, available-for-sale fixed maturity securities and loan receivables, the Company includes the change in present value due to the passage of time in the change in the allowance for credit losses. The Company’s methodology for estimating credit losses utilizes the contractual maturity date of the financial asset, adjusted when necessary to reflect the expected timing of repayment (such as prepayment options, renewal options, call options, or extension options). The Company applies reasonable and supportable forecasts of macroeconomic variables that impact the determination of PD/LGD over a two-year period for held-to-maturity fixed maturity securities and MMLs. The Company reverts to historical loss information over one year, \\n114\\nItem 8.

For the CML and TRE portfolio, the Company applies reasonable and supportable forecasts of macroeconomic variables as well as national and local real-estate market factors to estimate future credit losses where the market factors revert back to historical levels over time with the period being dependent on current market conditions, projected market conditions and difference in the current and historical market levels for each factor. The Company continuously monitors the estimation methodology, due to changes in portfolio composition, changes in underwriting practices and significant events or conditions and makes adjustments as necessary.\\nThe Company’s held-to-maturity fixed maturity portfolio includes Japan Government and Agency securities of $\\n20.9\\n billion amortized cost as of December\\xa031, 2021 that meet the requirements for zero-credit-loss expectation and therefore these asset classes have been excluded from the current expected credit loss measurement.\\nAn investment in an available-for-sale fixed maturity security is impaired if the fair value falls below amortized cost. The Company regularly reviews its fixed maturity security investments portfolio for declines in fair value. The Company's debt impairment model focuses on the ultimate collection of the cash flows from its investments and whether the Company has the intent to sell or if it is more likely than not the Company would be required to sell the security prior to recovery of its amortized cost. The determination of the amount of impairments under this model is based upon the Company's periodic evaluation and assessment of known and inherent risks associated with the respective securities. Such evaluations and assessments are revised as conditions change and new information becomes available.\", metadata={'source': 'https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/4977/000000497722000058/0000004977-22-000058-index.htm', 'documentId': '0000004977-22-000058-item7a-chunk0073'}),\n Document(page_content=\"When determining the Company's intention to sell a security prior to recovery of its fair value to amortized cost, the Company evaluates facts and circumstances such as, but not limited to, future cash flow needs, decisions to reposition its security portfolio, and risk profile of individual investment holdings.

The risk of counterparty default for the Company's foreign currency swaps, certain foreign currency forwards, and foreign currency options is mitigated by collateral posting requirements that counterparties to those transactions must meet. \\nAs of December\\xa031, 2021, all of the Company's derivative agreement counterparties were investment grade.\", metadata={'source': 'https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/4977/000000497722000058/0000004977-22-000058-index.htm', 'documentId': '0000004977-22-000058-item7a-chunk0094'}),\n Document(page_content=\"As of December\\xa031, 2021, all of the Company's derivative agreement counterparties were investment grade.  \\nThe Company engages in over-the-counter (OTC) bilateral derivative transactions directly with unaffiliated third parties under International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc. (ISDA) agreements and other documentation. Most of the ISDA agreements also include Credit Support Annexes (CSAs) provisions, which generally provide for two-way collateral postings at the first dollar of exposure. The Company mitigates the risk that counterparties to transactions might be unable to fulfill their contractual obligations by monitoring counterparty credit exposure and collateral value while generally requiring that collateral be posted at the outset of the transaction. In addition, a significant portion of the derivative transactions have provisions that give the counterparty the right to terminate the transaction upon a downgrade of the Company's financial strength rating. The actual amount of payments that the Company could be required to make depends on market conditions, the fair value of outstanding affected transactions, and other factors prevailing at and after the time of the downgrade.\\nThe Company also engages in OTC cleared derivative transactions through regulated central clearing counterparties. These positions are marked to market and margined on a daily basis (both initial margin and variation margin), and the Company has minimal exposure to credit-related losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to these derivatives.\\nCollateral posted by the Company to third parties for derivative transactions can generally be repledged or resold by the counterparties.

The Company is generally allowed to sell or repledge collateral obtained from its derivative counterparties, although it does not typically exercise such rights. (See the Offsetting tables below for collateral posted or received as of the reported balance sheet dates.)\\nOffsetting of Financial Instruments and Derivatives\\nMost of the Company's derivative instruments are subject to enforceable master netting arrangements that provide for the net settlement of all derivative contracts between the Parent Company or its subsidiaries and the respective counterparty in the event of default or upon the occurrence of certain termination events. Collateral support agreements with the master netting arrangements generally provide that the Company will receive or pledge financial collateral at the first dollar of exposure. \\nThe Company has securities lending agreements with unaffiliated financial institutions that post collateral to the Company in return for the use of its fixed maturity and public equity securities (see Note 3). When the Company has entered into securities lending agreements with the same counterparty, the agreements generally provide for net settlement in the event of default by the counterparty. This right of set-off allows the Company to keep and apply collateral received if the counterparty failed to return the securities borrowed from the Company as contractually agreed.

These two types of inputs create three valuation hierarchy levels. Level 1 valuations reflect quoted market prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets. Level 2 valuations reflect quoted market prices for similar assets or liabilities in an active market, quoted market prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in non-active markets or model-derived valuations in which all significant valuation inputs are observable in active markets.

These models take into consideration any unique characteristics of the securities and make various adjustments to arrive at an appropriate issuer-specific loss adjusted credit curve.\\xa0This credit curve is then used with the relevant recovery rates to estimate expected cash flows and modeling of additional features, including illiquidity adjustments, if necessary, to price the security by discounting those loss adjusted cash flows.

Their fair values are based on observable market inputs, therefore they are classified as Level 2.   \\nTo determine the fair value of its interest rate derivatives, the Company uses inputs that are generally observable in the market or can be derived from observable market data. Interest rate swaps are cleared trades. In a cleared swap contract, the clearinghouse provides benefits to the counterparties similar to contracts listed for investment traded on an exchange since it maintains a daily margin to mitigate counterparties' credit risk. These derivatives are priced using observable inputs, accordingly, they are classified as Level 2.

Nevertheless, the Company has full transparency into the contracts to properly value the swaps for reporting purposes. Prior to October 1, 2021, these derivatives were classified as Level 3 because certain significant inputs were determined to be unobservable, primarily due to the long duration of the swaps which required extrapolation beyond the observable limits of the curve(s). However, due to the natural aging of the swap portfolio and the continued evolution of capital market inputs, especially the availability of long-term interest rates with tenors beyond 30 years, the Company has concluded that all significant inputs are now observable. As a result, effective October 1, 2021, the Company transferred the derivatives associated with its consolidated VIEs to Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.\\nFor forward bond purchase commitments with VIEs, the fair value of the derivative is based on the difference in the fixed purchase price and the current market value of the related bond prior to the settlement date.

The Company's loan receivables do not have readily determinable market prices and generally lack market liquidity. Fair values for loan receivables are determined based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the applicable U.S. Treasury or floating-rate benchmark yield plus an appropriate spread that considers other risk factors, such as credit and liquidity risk. The spreads are a significant component of the pricing inputs and are generally considered unobservable. Therefore, these investments have been assigned a Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy.\\nOther investments\\nOther investments includes short-term investments that are measured at fair value where amortized cost approximates fair value.\\nOther policyholders' funds\\nThe largest component of the other policyholders' funds liability is the Company's annuity line of business in Aflac Japan. The Company's annuities have fixed benefits and premiums. For this product, the Company estimates the fair value to be equal to the cash surrender value. This is analogous to the value paid to policyholders on the valuation date if they were to surrender their policy. The Company periodically checks the cash value against discounted cash flow projections for reasonableness. The Company considers its inputs for this valuation to be unobservable and have accordingly classified this valuation as Level 3.  \\nNotes payable\\nThe fair values of the Company's publicly issued notes payable are determined by utilizing available sources of observable inputs from third party pricing vendors and are classified as Level 2.

Offered quotes are an unobservable input in the determination of fair value of mortgage- and asset-backed securities, certain banks/financial institutions, certain other corporate, and equity securities investments.\\nInterest Rates and CDS Spreads\\nThe significant drivers of the valuation of the foreign exchange swaps are interest rates and CDS spreads. Some of the Company's swaps have long maturities that increase the sensitivity of the swaps to interest rate fluctuations. For the Company's foreign exchange or cross currency swaps that are in a net asset position, an increase in yen interest rates (all other factors held constant) will decrease the present value of the yen final settlement receivable (receive leg), thus decreasing the value of the swap as long as the derivative remains in a net asset position.\", metadata={'source': 'https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/4977/000000497722000058/0000004977-22-000058-index.htm', 'documentId': '0000004977-22-000058-item7a-chunk0117'}),\n Document(page_content=\"Foreign exchange swaps also have a lump-sum final settlement of foreign exchange principal amounts at the termination of the swap. Assuming all other factors are held constant, an increase in yen interest rates will decrease the receive leg and decrease the net value of the swap. Likewise, holding all other factors constant, an increase in U.S. dollar interest rates will increase the swap's net value due to the decrease in the present value of the dollar final settlement payable (pay leg).\\nThe extinguisher feature in most of the Company's VIE swaps results in a cessation of cash flows and no further payments between the parties to the swap in the event of a default on the referenced or underlying collateral. To price this feature, the Company applies the survival probability of the referenced entity to the projected cash flows. The survival probability uses the CDS spreads and recovery rates to adjust the present value of the cash flows. For extinguisher swaps with positive values, an increase in CDS spreads decreases the likelihood of receiving the final exchange payments and reduces the value of the swap. \\nEffective October 1, 2021, the foreign exchange swaps mentioned above were transferred from level 3 to level 2 because the significant inputs used for their valuation that were previously unobservable are now observable.\\nFor additional information on the Company's investments and financial instruments, see the accompanying Notes 1, 3 and 4.\\n6. \\nDEFERRED POLICY ACQUISITION COSTS AND INSURANCE EXPENSES\\nConsolidated policy acquisition costs deferred were $\\n1.1\\n billion in 2021, compared with $\\n1.2\\n\\xa0billion in 2020 and $\\n1.5\\n\\xa0billion in 2019. \\nThe following table presents a rollforward of deferred policy acquisition costs by segment for the years ended December\\xa031.\\n144\\nItem 8.

During 2021 and 2020, there were impacts from lower utilization of healthcare services, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This impacted both cancer and medical products, as the Japan population was avoiding doctor and hospital visits, and staying home more. This resulted in lower sickness, accident, and cancer incurred claims.  In addition, dating back to before the pandemic, cancer treatment patterns in Japan are continuing to be influenced by significant advances in early-detection techniques and by the increased use of pathological diagnosis rather than clinical exams. Additionally, follow-up radiation and chemotherapy treatments are occurring more often on an outpatient basis. Such changes in treatment not only increase the quality of life and initial outcomes for the patients, but also decrease the average length of each hospital stay, resulting in favorable claims development.', metadata={'source': 'https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/4977/000000497722000058/0000004977-22-000058-index.htm', 'documentId': '0000004977-22-000058-item7a-chunk0121'}),\n Document(page_content=\"In 2021, as experienced in 2020 and 2019, the majority of the Company's major U.S. accident and health lines of business, including accident, hospital indemnity, cancer, critical illness and short-term disability, the incurred claims development related to prior years reflects favorable claims experience compared to previous estimates.

The Company has determined no valuation allowance against its anticipatory foreign tax credits is necessary. The anticipatory foreign tax credit represents the foreign tax credit the Company will generate from the reversal of Japan deferred tax liabilities in the future. The release of the valuation allowance on the anticipatory foreign tax credit is due to the regulations addressing the allocation of insurance expenses in the calculation of the foreign tax credit released September 29, 2020. The Company has also determined no valuation allowance against its deferred foreign tax credits is necessary. Deferred foreign tax credits are foreign tax credits generated in the current tax year by the Japanese life company, but are unable to be utilized until 2022 due to Japan's current tax year not closing until March 31, 2022.

Expected volatility is based on historical periods generally commensurate with the estimated terms of the options. The Company uses historical data to estimate option exercise and termination patterns within the model. Separate groups of employees that have similar historical exercise patterns are stratified and considered separately for valuation purposes. The expected term of options granted is derived from the output of the Company's option model and represents the weighted-average period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding.

Furthermore, the Company seeks to accomplish these objectives in a manner that allows for the adequate funding of plan benefits and expenses. In order to achieve these objectives, the Company's goal is to maintain a conservative, well-diversified and balanced portfolio of high-quality equity, fixed-income and money market securities. As a part of its strategy, the Company has established strict policies covering quality, type and concentration of investment securities. For the Company's Japanese plan, these policies include limitations on investments in derivatives including futures, options and swaps, and low-liquidity investments such as real estate, venture capital investments, and privately issued securities. For the Company's U.S. plan, these policies prohibit investments in precious metals, limited partnerships, venture capital, and direct investments in real estate. The Company is also prohibited from trading on margin. \\nThe plan fiduciaries for the Company's funded defined benefit plans have developed guidelines for asset allocations reflecting a percentage of total assets by asset class, which are reviewed on an annual basis. \\nAsset allocation targets as of December\\xa031, 2021 were as follows:\\nJapan Pension\\nU.S. Pension\\nDomestic equities\\n5\\n\\xa0\\n%\\n40\\n\\xa0\\n%\\nInternational equities\\n21\\n\\xa0\\n20\\n\\xa0\\nFixed income securities\\n66\\n\\xa0\\n40\\n\\xa0\\nOther\\n8\\n\\xa0\\n0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Total\\n100\\n\\xa0\\n%\\n100\\n\\xa0\\n%\\nThe following table presents the fair value of Aflac Japan's pension plan assets that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31.

Some of our competitors may enjoy better competitive positions in certain geographical areas, with certain consumer and service professional demographics and/or in other key areas that we currently serve or may serve in the future. Generally, we compete with search engines, online marketplaces and social media platforms that have the ability to market their products and services online in a more prominent and cost-effective manner than we can, as well as better tailor their products and services to individual users. Any of these advantages could enable these competitors to offer products and services that are more appealing to consumers and service professionals than our products and services, respond more quickly and/or cost effectively than we do to evolving market opportunities and trends, and/or display their own integrated or related home services products and services in search results and elsewhere in a more prominent manner than our products and services, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.', metadata={'source': 'https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1705110/000170511022000021/0001705110-22-000021-index.htm', 'documentId': '0001705110-22-000021-item1a-chunk0001'}),\n Document(page_content='In addition, since most home services products and services are offered to consumers for free, consumers can easily switch among home services offerings (or use multiple home services offerings simultaneously) at no cost to them. And while service professionals may incur additional or duplicative near-term costs, the costs for switching to a competing platform over the long term are generally not prohibitive. Low switching costs, coupled with the propensity of consumers to try new products and services generally, will most likely result in the continued emergence of new products and services, entrants and business models in the home services industry. Our inability to continue to innovate and compete effectively against new products, services and competitors could result in decreases in the size and level of engagement of our consumer and service professional bases, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\\nOur success will depend, in substantial part, on the continued migration of the home services market online.', metadata={'source': 'https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1705110/000170511022000021/0001705110-22-000021-index.htm', 'documentId': '0001705110-22-000021-item1a-chunk0002'}),\n Document(page_content='Our success will depend, in substantial part, on the continued migration of the home services market online.\\nWe believe that the digital penetration of the home services market remains low, with the vast majority of consumers continuing to search for, select and hire service professionals offline. While many consumers have historically been (and remain) averse to finding service professionals online, others have demonstrated a greater willingness to embrace the online shift. Service professionals must also continue to embrace the online shift, which will depend, in substantial part, on whether online products and services help them to better connect and engage with consumers relative to traditional offline efforts. The speed and ultimate outcome of the shift of the home services market online for consumers and service professionals is uncertain and may not occur as quickly as we expect, or at all.

When COVID-19 first impacted North America and Europe in the early spring of 2020, we experienced a decline in demand for service requests, driven primarily by decreases in demand in certain categories of jobs (particularly discretionary indoor projects). While we experienced a rebound in service requests in the second half of 2020 and through early 2021, service requests did start to decline in May 2021 compared to the comparable months of 2020 as a result of the surge in 2020 and due to impacts of our brand integration initiative that we commenced in March 2021. Moreover, many service professionals’ businesses have been adversely impacted by labor and material constraints and many service professionals have limited capacity to take on new business, which negatively impacted our ability to monetize the increased level of service requests through the first quarter of 2021.

Moreover, many service professionals’ businesses have been adversely impacted by labor and material constraints and many service professionals have limited capacity to take on new business, which continues to negatively impact our ability to monetize the slightly increased level of service requests. Although our ability to monetize service requests rebounded modestly in the second half of 2021, we still have not returned to levels we experienced pre-COVID-19.

The increase in advertising expense was due primarily to increases of $52.8 million in online marketing spend and $9.6 million in television spend. The increase in online marketing spend was attributable to the brand integration initiative described above under “Brand Integration Initiative.” The increase in television spend in 2021 reflects the return to historical spending levels as compared to the cost cutting initiatives during 2020 due to the impact of COVID-19. The increase in compensation expense was due primarily to increased commission expense, in addition to an increase in sales force headcount, net of an equity based compensation capitalization increase.

This measure is one of the primary metrics by which we evaluate the performance of our businesses, on which our internal budgets are based and by which management is compensated. We believe that investors should have access to, and we are obligated to provide, the same set of tools that we use in analyzing our results. This non-GAAP measure should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP, but should not be considered a substitute for or superior to GAAP results. We endeavor to compensate for the limitations of the non-GAAP measure presented by providing the comparable GAAP measure with equal or greater prominence and descriptions of the reconciling items, including quantifying such items, to derive the non-GAAP measure. We encourage investors to examine the reconciling adjustments between the GAAP and non-GAAP measure, which we discuss below.\\nDefinition of Non-GAAP Measure\\nAdjusted Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (“Adjusted EBITDA”)\\n is defined as operating income excluding: (1)\\xa0stock-based compensation expense; (2)\\xa0depreciation; and (3)\\xa0acquisition-related items consisting of amortization of intangible assets and impairments of goodwill and intangible assets, if applicable. We believe this measure is useful for analysts and investors as this measure allows a more meaningful comparison between our performance and that of our competitors. Adjusted EBITDA has certain limitations because it excludes the impact of these expenses.\\nThe following table reconciles net loss attributable to Angi Inc. shareholders to operating loss to consolidated Adjusted EBITDA:\\n\\xa0\\nYears Ended December 31,\\n\\xa0\\n2021\\n2020\\n\\xa0\\n(In\\xa0thousands)\\nNet loss attributable to Angi Inc. shareholders\\n$\\n(71,378)\\n$\\n(6,283)\\nAdd back:\\nNet earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests\\n884', metadata={'source': 'https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1705110/000170511022000021/0001705110-22-000021-index.htm', 'documentId': '0001705110-22-000021-item7-chunk0018'}),\n Document(page_content='Years Ended December 31,\\n\\xa0\\n2021\\n2020\\n\\xa0\\n(In\\xa0thousands)\\nNet loss attributable to Angi Inc. shareholders\\n$\\n(71,378)\\n$\\n(6,283)\\nAdd back:\\nNet earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests\\n884\\xa0\\n2,123\\xa0\\nIncome tax benefit\\n(32,013)\\n(15,168)\\nOther expense (income), net\\n2,509\\xa0\\n(1,218)\\nInterest expense\\n23,485\\xa0\\n14,178\\xa0\\nOperating loss\\n(76,513)\\n(6,368)\\nAdd back:\\nStock-based compensation expense\\n28,702\\xa0\\n83,649\\xa0\\nDepreciation   \\n59,246\\xa0\\n52,621\\xa0\\nAmortization of intangibles   \\n16,430\\xa0\\n42,902\\xa0\\nAdjusted EBITDA\\n$\\n27,865\\xa0\\n$\\n172,804\\xa0\\nFor a reconciliation of operating loss to Adjusted EBITDA for the Company’s reportable segments, see “\\nNote 1\\n1\\n—Segment Information\\n” to the consolidated financial statements included in “\\nItem 8.

At the time of an acquisition, the identifiable definite-lived intangible assets of the acquired company, such as service professional relationships, technology, memberships, customer lists and user base, and trade names, are valued and amortized over their estimated lives. Value is also assigned to acquired indefinite-lived intangible assets, which comprise trade names and trademarks, and goodwill that are not subject to amortization. An impairment is recorded when the carrying value of an intangible asset or goodwill exceeds its fair value. We believe that intangible assets represent costs incurred by the acquired company to build value prior to acquisition and the related amortization and impairments of intangible assets or goodwill, if applicable, are not ongoing costs of doing business.\\n38\\nTable of Contents\\nFINANCIAL POSITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\\nFinancial Position\\nDecember 31, 2021\\nDecember 31, 2020\\n(In thousands)\\nCash and cash equivalents and marketable debt securities:\\nUnited States\\n$\\n404,277\\xa0\\n$\\n793,679\\xa0\\nAll other countries\\n23,859\\xa0\\n19,026\\xa0\\nTotal cash and cash equivalents\\n428,136\\xa0\\n812,705\\xa0\\nMarketable debt securities (United States)\\n—\\xa0\\n49,995\\xa0\\nTotal cash and cash equivalents and marketable debt securities\\n$\\n428,136\\xa0\\n$\\n862,700\\xa0\\nLong-term debt:\\nSenior Notes\\n$\\n500,000\\xa0\\n$\\n500,000\\xa0\\nTerm Loan\\n—\\xa0\\n220,000\\xa0\\nTotal long-term debt\\n500,000\\xa0\\n720,000\\xa0\\nLess: unamortized debt issuance costs\\n5,448\\xa0\\n7,723\\xa0\\nTotal long-term debt, net\\n$\\n494,552\\xa0\\n$\\n712,277', metadata={'source': 'https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1705110/000170511022000021/0001705110-22-000021-index.htm', 'documentId': '0001705110-22-000021-item7-chunk0020'}),\n Document(page_content='Senior Notes\\n$\\n500,000\\xa0\\n$\\n500,000\\xa0\\nTerm Loan\\n—\\xa0\\n220,000\\xa0\\nTotal long-term debt\\n500,000\\xa0\\n720,000\\xa0\\nLess: unamortized debt issuance costs\\n5,448\\xa0\\n7,723\\xa0\\nTotal long-term debt, net\\n$\\n494,552\\xa0\\n$\\n712,277\\xa0\\nAt December\\xa031, 2021, all of the Company’s international cash can be repatriated without any significant tax consequences.\\nCash Flow Information\\nIn summary, the Company’s cash flows are as follows:\\nYears Ended December 31,\\n2021\\n2020\\n(In thousands)\\nNet cash provided (used in) by:\\nOperating activities   \\n$\\n6,209\\xa0\\n$\\n188,419\\xa0\\nInvesting activities   \\n$\\n(45,072)\\n$\\n(103,954)\\nFinancing activities   \\n$\\n(345,168)\\n$\\n337,053\\xa0\\nNet cash provided by operating activities consists of earnings adjusted for non-cash items and the effect of changes in working capital.

Due to the higher degree of complexity associated with the valuation of intangible assets, the Company usually obtains the assistance of outside valuation experts in the allocation of purchase price to the identifiable intangible assets acquired, which can be both definite-lived, such as acquired technology, customer and contractor relationships, or indefinite lived, such as acquired trade names and trademarks. While outside valuation experts may be used, management has ultimate responsibility for the valuation methods, models and inputs used and the resulting purchase price allocation.

Although management currently believes changes to unrecognized tax benefits from period to period and differences between amounts paid, if any, upon resolution of issues raised in audits and amounts previously provided will not have a material impact on the liquidity, results of operations, or financial condition of the Company, these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and management’s view of these matters may change in the future.\\nThe ultimate amount of deferred income tax assets realized and the amounts paid for deferred income tax liabilities and unrecognized tax benefits may vary from our estimates due to future changes in income tax law, state income tax apportionment \\n45\\nTable of Contents', metadata={'source': 'https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1705110/000170511022000021/0001705110-22-000021-index.htm', 'documentId': '0001705110-22-000021-item7-chunk0041'}),\n Document(page_content='45\\nTable of Contents\\nor the outcome of any review of our tax returns by the various tax authorities, as well as actual operating results of the Company that vary significantly from anticipated results.\\nThe Company regularly assesses the realizability of deferred tax assets considering all available evidence including, to the extent applicable, the nature, frequency and severity of prior cumulative losses, forecasts of future taxable income, tax filing status, the duration of statutory carryforward periods, available tax planning and historical experience. As of December 31, 2021, the Company is in a three-year cumulative loss position. The Company’s most significant net deferred tax asset relates to U.S. federal net operating loss (“NOL”) carryforwards of  $124.5 million. The Company expects to generate future taxable income of at least $592.9 million prior to the expiration of these NOLs, $372.2 million of which expire between 2030 and 2037, and the remainder of which never expire, to fully realize this deferred tax asset.\\nStock-Based Compensation\\nThe stock-based compensation expense reflected in our statements of operations includes expense related to the Company’s  stock options, stock appreciation rights, RSU awards, including those that are linked to the achievement of the Company’s stock price, known as market-based awards (“MSUs”) and those that are linked to the achievement of a performance target, known as performance-based awards (“PSUs”), equity instruments denominated in shares of subsidiaries, and IAC denominated stock options.', metadata={'source': 'https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1705110/000170511022000021/0001705110-22-000021-index.htm', 'documentId': '0001705110-22-000021-item7-chunk0042'}),\n Document(page_content='The Company recorded stock-based compensation expense of $28.7 million and $83.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

These modified awards finished vesting in the first quarter of 2021. Additionally, in the first quarter of 2021, the Company recognized a net decrease of $7.7 million due to the reversal of previously recognized expense related to unvested awards that were forfeited due to management departures, and, in connection with the departure of the president and chief operating officer of the Company in December 2020, the Company recognized $14.1 million of expense related to the acceleration of vesting of his unvested stock appreciation rights and RSUs and the extension of the post-termination exercise period for his vested and exercisable stock appreciation rights.', metadata={'source': 'https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1705110/000170511022000021/0001705110-22-000021-index.htm', 'documentId': '0001705110-22-000021-item7-chunk0043'}),\n Document(page_content='Stock-based compensation at the Company is complex due to our desire to attract, retain, inspire and reward outstanding entrepreneurs and managers at the Company, including recently acquired companies, by allowing them to benefit directly from the value they help to create. We accomplish these objectives, in part, by issuing equity awards denominated in the equity of our subsidiaries as well as in Angi Inc. We further refine this approach by tailoring certain equity awards to the applicable circumstances. For example, we issue certain equity awards for which vesting is linked to the achievement of a performance target such as revenue or profits; these awards are referred to as performance-based awards. In other cases, we link the vesting of equity awards to the achievement of a value target for a subsidiary or Angi Inc.’s stock price, as applicable; these awards are referred to as market-based awards. The nature and variety of these types of equity-based awards creates complexity in our determination of stock-based compensation expense. \\nIn addition, acquisitions are an important part of the Company’s growth strategy. These transactions may result in the modification of equity awards which creates additional complexity and additional stock-based compensation expense. Also, our internal reorganizations can also lead to modifications of equity awards and result in additional complexity and stock-based compensation expense. \\nFinally, the means by which we settle our equity-based awards also introduces complexity into our financial reporting. We provide a path to liquidity by settling the subsidiary denominated awards in IAC or Angi Inc. shares. In addition, certain former HomeAdvisor (US) awards can be settled in IAC or Angi Inc. awards at IAC’s election. These features increase the complexity of our earnings per share calculations.', metadata={'source': 'https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1705110/000170511022000021/0001705110-22-000021-index.htm', 'documentId': '0001705110-22-000021-item7-chunk0044'}),\n Document(page_content='There were no stock options or stock appreciation rights granted by the Company for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 or 2019. The Company estimates the fair value of newly granted or modified stock appreciation rights and stock options, including equity instruments denominated in shares of subsidiaries, using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires the use of highly subjective and complex assumptions, the most significant of which include expected term, expected volatility of the underlying shares, risk-free interest rates and the expected dividend yield. In addition, the recognition of stock-based compensation expense is impacted by our estimated forfeiture rates, which are based, in part, on historical forfeiture rates. For stock appreciation rights and stock options, including equity instruments denominated in shares of subsidiaries, the grant date fair value of the award is recognized as an expense on a straight-line basis, net of estimated forfeitures, over the requisite service period, which is the vesting period of the award. The Company also issues RSUs, PSUs \\n46\\nTable of Contents\\nand MSUs. For RSUs, the value of the instrument is measured at the grant date as the fair value of the underlying Angi’s common stock and expensed as stock-based compensation expense over the vesting term. For PSUs, the value of the instrument is measured at the grant date as the fair value of the underlying Angi’s common stock and expensed as stock-based compensation over the vesting term when the performance targets are considered probable of being achieved. For MSUs, a lattice model is used to estimate the value of the awards. \\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\\nFor a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements, see “\\nNote\\xa02—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\\n” to the consolidated financial statements included in “\\nItem 8.

If market rates decline, the Company runs the risk that the related required payments of the ANGI Group Senior Notes will exceed those based on market rates. A 100-basis point increase or decrease in the level of interest rates would, respectively, decrease or increase the fair value of the fixed-rate debt by $28.4 million. Such potential increase or decrease in fair value is based on certain simplifying assumptions, including an immediate increase or decrease in the level of interest rates with no other subsequent changes for the remainder of the period. \\nForeign Currency Exchange Risk\\nThe Company has operations in certain foreign markets, primarily in various jurisdictions within the European Union and the United Kingdom. The Company has exposure to foreign currency exchange risk related to its foreign subsidiaries that transact business in a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar. As a result, as foreign currency exchange rates fluctuate, the translation of the statement of operations of the Company’s international businesses into U.S. dollars affects year-over-year comparability of operating results. \\nIn addition, certain of the Company’s U.S. operations have customers in international markets.

Angi Services allows consumers to browse and buy common household services at set prices, rather than requesting quotes from vetted service professionals, as well as instantly book appointments online for household services (primarily cleaning and handyman services) with top-quality, pre-screened independent service professionals. Consumers can request and pay for household services directly through the Angi platform and Angi fulfills the request through the use of independently established home services providers engaged in a trade, occupation and/or business that customarily provides such services.

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company, all entities that are wholly-owned by the Company and all entities in which the Company has a controlling financial interest.

While we experienced a rebound in service requests in the second half of 2020 and through early 2021, service requests did start to decline in May 2021 compared to the comparable months of 2020 as a result of the surge in 2020 and due to impacts of the brand integration initiative launched in March 2021. Moreover, many service professionals’ businesses have \\n56\\nTable of Contents\\nANGI INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\\nbeen adversely impacted by labor and material constraints and many service professionals have limited capacity to take on new business, which continue to negatively impact our ability to monetize the slightly increased level of service requests. Although our ability to monetize service requests rebounded modestly in the second half 2021, we still have not returned to levels we experienced pre-COVID-19. No assurances can be provided that we will continue to be able to improve monetization, or that service professionals’ businesses and, as a consequence, our revenue and profitability will not be adversely impacted in the future.', metadata={'source': 'https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1705110/000170511022000021/0001705110-22-000021-index.htm', 'documentId': '0001705110-22-000021-item7a-chunk0015'}),\n Document(page_content='The extent to which developments related to the COVID-19 pandemic and measures designed to curb its spread continue to impact the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations will depend on future developments, all of which are highly uncertain and many of which are beyond the Company’s control, including the continuing spread of COVID-19, the severity of resurgences of COVID-19 caused by variant strains of the virus, the effectiveness of vaccines and attitudes toward receiving them, materials and supply chain constraints, labor shortages, the scope of governmental and other restrictions on travel, discretionary services and other activity, and public reactions to these developments.\\nAccounting Estimates\\nManagement of the Company is required to make certain estimates, judgments, and assumptions during the preparation of its consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP. These estimates, judgments, and assumptions impact the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results could differ from these estimates.', metadata={'source': 'https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1705110/000170511022000021/0001705110-22-000021-index.htm', 'documentId': '0001705110-22-000021-item7a-chunk0016'}),\n Document(page_content='On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates and judgments, including those related to: the fair values of cash equivalents and marketable debt securities; the carrying value of accounts receivable, including the determination of the allowance for credit losses and the determination of revenue reserves; the determination of the customer relationship period for certain costs to obtain a contract with a customer; the carrying value of right-of-use assets (“ROU assets”); the useful lives and recoverability of definite-lived intangible assets and capitalized software, leasehold improvements, and equipment; the recoverability of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets; unrecognized tax benefits; the valuation allowance for deferred income tax assets; and the fair value of and forfeiture rates for stock-based awards, among others.

Consumer connection revenue varies based upon several factors, including the service requested, product experience offered and geographic location of service. Consumer connection revenue is generally billed one week following a consumer match, with payment due upon receipt of invoice. The Company maintains revenue reserves for potential credits issued to Angi Leads services providers.\\nRevenue is also derived from (i) sales of time-based website, mobile and call center advertising to service professionals, (ii) Angi Leads service professional membership subscription fees, (iii) membership subscription fees from consumers, (iv) service warranty subscription and other services and (v) revenue from completed jobs sourced through the Angi Services platforms. Angi service professionals generally pay for advertisements in advance on a monthly or annual basis at the option of the service professional, with the average advertising contract term being approximately one year. Angi website, mobile and call center advertising revenue is recognized ratably over the contract term.

Angi prepaid consumer membership subscription fees are recognized as revenue using the straight-line method over the term of the applicable subscription period, which is typically one year. Consumers typically pay when a job is scheduled through the Angi Services platform, or when the job is completed for Angi Roofing. Billing practices are governed by the contract terms of each project as negotiated with the consumer. Billings do not necessarily correlate with revenue recognized over time as this is based on the timing of when the consumer receives the promised services.\\nPrior to January 1, 2020, Handy recorded revenue on a net basis. Effective January 1, 2020, the Company modified the Handy terms and conditions so that Handy, rather than the service professional, has the contractual relationship with the consumer to deliver the service and Handy, rather than the consumer, has the contractual relationship with the service professional. Consumers request services and pay for such services directly through the Handy platform and then Handy fulfills the request with independently established home services providers engaged in a trade, occupation and/or business that customarily provides such services.

For such arrangements, the Company allocates revenue to each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price. The Company generally determines standalone selling prices based on the prices charged to customers, which are directly observable or based on an estimate if not directly observable.\\nAssets Recognized from the Costs to Obtain a Contract with a Customer\\nThe Company has determined that certain costs, primarily commissions paid to employees pursuant to certain sales incentive programs, meet the requirements to be capitalized as a cost of obtaining a contract. Capitalized sales commissions are amortized over the estimated customer relationship period. The Company calculates the estimated customer relationship period as the average customer life, which is based on historical data. When customer renewals are expected and the renewal commission is not commensurate with the initial commission, the average customer life includes renewal periods. For sales incentive programs where the customer relationship period is one year or less, the Company has elected the practical expedient to expense the costs as incurred.\\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 and the Company recognized expense of $\\n84.7\\n million and $\\n64.8', metadata={'source': 'https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1705110/000170511022000021/0001705110-22-000021-index.htm', 'documentId': '0001705110-22-000021-item7a-chunk0020'}),\n Document(page_content='During the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 and the Company recognized expense of $\\n84.7\\n million and $\\n64.8\\n million, respectively, related to the amortization of these costs.

The time between the Company’s issuance of an invoice and payment due date is not significant; customer payments that are not collected in advance of the transfer of promised services or goods are generally due no later than 30 days from invoice date.

Factors the Company considers in making such determination include the duration, severity and reason for the decline in value and the potential recovery and our intent to sell the debt security. The Company also considers whether it will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis and whether the amortized cost basis cannot be recovered because of credit losses.

Determining fair value using a DCF analysis requires the exercise of significant judgment with respect to several items, including the amount and timing of expected future cash flows and appropriate discount rates. The expected cash flows used in the DCF analyses are based on the Company’s most recent forecast and budget and, for years beyond the budget, the Company’s estimates, which are based, in part, on forecasted growth rates. The discount rates used in the DCF analyses are intended to reflect the risks inherent in the expected future cash flows of the respective reporting units.

The Company determines the fair value of indefinite-lived intangible assets using an avoided royalty DCF valuation analysis.

The carrying value of a long-lived asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset.

These audits include questioning the timing and the amount of income and deductions and the allocation of income and deductions among various tax jurisdictions. The Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) has substantially completed its audit of IAC’s federal income tax returns for the years ended December 31, 2013 through 2017, and has begun its audit of the years December 31, 2018 through 2019, which includes the operations of the Company. The statutes of limitations for the years 2013 through 2019 have been extended to December 31, 2023. Returns filed in various other jurisdictions are open to examination for various tax years beginning with 2009. Income taxes payable include unrecognized tax benefits considered sufficient to pay assessments that may result from examination of prior year tax returns. The Company considers many factors when evaluating and estimating its tax positions and tax benefits, which may not accurately anticipate actual outcomes and, therefore, may require periodic adjustment.

The value of the stock appreciation rights is tied to the value of the common stock of these subsidiaries, which is determined by the Company using a variety of valuation techniques including a combination of market based and discounted cash flow valuation methodologies. Accordingly, these interests only have value to the extent the relevant business appreciates in value above the initial value utilized to determine the exercise price. These interests can have significant value in the event of significant appreciation. The fair value of these interests is generally determined by the board of directors of the applicable subsidiary when settled, which will occur at various dates through 2026 and are ultimately settled in IAC common stock or Angi Inc. Class A common stock, at IAC’s election. These equity awards are settled on a net basis, with the award holder entitled to receive a payment in shares equal to the intrinsic value of the award at exercise less an amount equal to the required cash tax withholding payment. The expense associated with these equity awards is initially measured at fair value, using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, at the grant date and is expensed as stock-based compensation over the vesting term.\\nThe plans under which these awards are granted establish specific settlement dates or liquidity events for which the valuation of the relevant subsidiary is determined for purposes of settlement of the awards.\\nNOTE 11—\\nSEGMENT INFORMATION\\nThe overall concept that the Company employs in determining its operating segments is to present the financial information in a manner consistent with how the chief operating decision maker views the businesses.

ROU assets and related lease liabilities are based on the present value of fixed lease payments over the lease term using the Company’s incremental borrowing rate on the lease commencement date or January 1, 2019 for leases that commenced prior to that date. The Company combines the lease and non-lease components of lease payments in determining ROU assets and related lease liabilities. If the lease includes one or more options to extend the term of the lease, the renewal option is considered in the lease term if it is reasonably certain the Company will exercise the option(s). Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. As permitted by ASC 842, leases with an initial term of twelve months or less (“short-term leases”) are not recorded on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.\\nVariable lease payments consist primarily of common area maintenance, utilities, and taxes, which are not included in the recognition of ROU assets and related lease liabilities.

Cancer cells leverage CD47, a cell surface protein, as a “don’t eat me” signal to evade detection by the immune system. Our company is developing a next-generation checkpoint inhibitor designed to have a high affinity for CD47 and to avoid the limitations caused by hematologic toxicities inherent in other CD47 blocking approaches.

In response, cancer cells frequently overexpress CD47 to counteract these “eat me” signals. As a result, high expression of CD47 on cancer cells has been associated with reduced patient survival in multiple cancers. The therapeutic blockade of CD47 in combination with an “eat me” signal enables the immune system to detect and phagocytose cancer cells. However, healthy blood cells and nearly all other cells in the body also express CD47 as a way to protect against pathologic phagocytosis by immune cells. There have been a number of approaches to blocking CD47, including monoclonal antibodies and fusion proteins that include an active Fc region. These approaches have encountered limitations, including limited dosing and therapeutic window, limited ability to combine with other anti-cancer agents, limited efficacy in solid tumors and limited indications due to patient selection, that have challenged their ability to maximize the full potential of CD47 blockade. In addition, most of these therapeutic approaches to CD47 blockade have resulted in the destruction of patients’ healthy blood cells, causing cytopenias that limit the dosing and therapeutic potential of those molecules. \\n\\n\\n1', metadata={'source': 'https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1810182/000156459022007364/0001564590-22-007364-index.htm', 'documentId': '0001564590-22-007364-item1-chunk0003'}),\n Document(page_content='1\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nALX Oncology was founded by Corey Goodman, Ph.D., K. Christopher Garcia, Ph.D., and Jaume Pons, Ph.D. to address fundamental challenges in blocking CD47 and to realize the full potential of this therapeutic target. We have developed a new approach to CD47 blockade that is designed to maximize clinical activity and minimize toxicities by designing a CD47 blocker with an inactivated Fc region. Clinical data on competing CD47 blockers to date have come from molecules that incorporate an active antibody Fc region in addition to a CD47 blocking region. The Fc region provides a positive, pro-phagocytic “eat me” signal to macrophages and other cells of the immune system. Since healthy blood cells also express CD47, these competing therapeutic approaches can cause a reduction in the number of blood cells in the body, resulting in anemia, thrombocytopenia and neutropenia, which can be dangerous to patients and may limit the ability to combine these agents with other anti-cancer medicines. \\n\\n\\nOur lead product candidate, evorpacept, is a next-generation CD47 blocking therapeutic that we believe has significantly enhanced properties compared to competing CD47 blocking approaches. Evorpacept is a fusion protein that combines a high-affinity CD47 binding domain with a proprietary inactivated Fc domain. The CD47 binding domain of evorpacept is an affinity enhanced extracellular domain of SIRPα, a protein that is the natural receptor to CD47 found on myeloid cells. We have engineered the Fc domain of evorpacept so that it does not provide a pro-phagocytic signal while still maintaining an antibody-like half-life for the molecule. We believe our inactive Fc approach improves tolerability when compared to other CD47 blocking approaches that have an Fc domain that engages activating receptors on macrophages, causing phagocytosis and death of healthy cells in addition to cancer cells.', metadata={'source': 'https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1810182/000156459022007364/0001564590-22-007364-index.htm', 'documentId': '0001564590-22-007364-item1-chunk0004'}),\n Document(page_content='Evorpacept’s design has several advantages that we believe will make it broadly applicable to treating a number of oncology indications. Due to the inactive Fc, evorpacept is specifically designed for use in combination with other anti-cancer agents that provide a positive immune-stimulating signal. We believe evorpacept has a favorable tolerability profile that may enable higher dosing levels and greater combination potential with other leading anti-cancer agents. Additionally, the molecular weight of evorpacept is half that of a typical antibody. The relatively smaller size of our molecule may facilitate increased penetrance into the tumor microenvironment. We believe these properties may enable evorpacept to provide superior therapeutic benefits. \\n\\n\\nClinical data to date in evorpacept have not shown dose-dependent hematologic toxicities, which are characteristic of other CD47 blockers that incorporate an active Fc domain.

We view this ORR as compelling evidence for the role of evorpacept in treating hematologic malignancies and as a favorable comparison to outcomes reported by other CD47 blocking agents in a similar patient population. Furthermore, other CD47 blocking agents in development have demonstrated clinical evidence supporting the role of CD47 blockade in treating hematologic malignances, specifically in both MDS and AML, albeit with high rates of cytopenias. We initially conducted preclinical studies of evorpacept combined with azacitidine or venetoclax that support our clinical development plan in MDS and AML. Azacitidine is a standard of care agent for the treatment of MDS. Azacitidine and venetoclax are both standard of care regimen components for the treatment of AML in older patients and those who are not candidates for intensive induction chemotherapy due to comorbidities. We have conducted preclinical studies that show that azacitidine and venetoclax increase both the display of the “eat me” signal calreticulin and the “don’t eat me” signal CD47 on AML cells, suggesting that a CD47 blocking agent could maximize the activity of venetoclax and azacitidine in these models.

Initial clinical successes in this area have focused on stimulating the adaptive immune system. However, emerging evidence demonstrates that the innate immune system plays a crucial role in the first line of defense to eliminate transformed malignant cells and the subsequent activation of the adaptive immune system. Dendritic cells and macrophages are a type of myeloid cell and are important parts of the innate immune system. These cells eliminate cancer cells by phagocytosis and present tumor-derived antigens to T cells, a process known as cross-priming, which activates the adaptive immune system. \\n\\n\\nCancer cells evade phagocytosis by up-regulating CD47, a transmembrane protein that mainly functions as an anti-phagocytic “don’t eat me” signal for healthy cells. CD47 interacts with its cognate receptor SIRPα, a regulatory membrane glycoprotein, that is expressed on macrophages and other myeloid cells and serves to prevent phagocytosis when bound to CD47. By overexpressing CD47, cancer cells are able to avoid phagocytosis by macrophages and thereby evade subsequent detection by the adaptive immune system.', metadata={'source': 'https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1810182/000156459022007364/0001564590-22-007364-index.htm', 'documentId': '0001564590-22-007364-item1-chunk0015'}),\n Document(page_content='High CD47 expression in cancer cells has been shown to be a prognostic indicator of decreased survival in multiple oncology indications. A study published by Majeti, et al. in 2009, assessed this association in a validation cohort of 137 subjects with AML. As shown in the figure below, normal karyotype AML, or NK-AML, subjects with high levels of CD47 expression had shorter median overall survival, or mOS, of 9.1 months compared to subjects with low levels of CD47 expression who had an mOS of 22.1 months. \\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nCD47 as a therapeutic checkpoint target \\n\\n\\nData generated by our and other studies in the field have demonstrated that activating the immune system against cancer requires both blocking phagocytosis checkpoints and inducing pro-phagocytic signals. This can be achieved by combining CD47 blockade with either conventional chemotherapies or targeted therapies, which together promote phagocytosis by macrophages and maximize adaptive immune system response. \\n\\n\\nExisting anti-cancer therapeutics can increase “eat me” signals on cancer cells. For example, the hypomethylating agent, or HMA, azacitidine activates the immune system by increasing display of calreticulin, a multifunctional protein, on cancer cells. Calreticulin is an important example of a pro-phagocytic “eat me” signal that potentiates immune response when expressed on cancer cells. Therapeutic antibodies that target tumor-specific antigens, such as the HER2 receptor, also induce cellular phagocytosis, but through a slightly different mechanism. These antibodies direct macrophages to cancer cells by binding to the tumor-specific antigen and activating the macrophage by engaging the Fcγ receptors to induce phagocytosis. However, if CD47 is not blocked, the “don’t eat me” signal can limit the activity of this mechanism. CD47 blocking therapies can therefore maximize a combination agent’s clinical efficacy by overcoming the “don’t eat me” signal that is co-opted by cancer cells. \\n\\n\\n6', metadata={'source': 'https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1810182/000156459022007364/0001564590-22-007364-index.htm', 'documentId': '0001564590-22-007364-item1-chunk0016'}),\n Document(page_content='6\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nOur lead product candidate, evorpacept, targets CD47 to maximize phagocytosis of cancer cells and activation of the adaptive immune system. \\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nCancer cells can also modulate their environment to suppress detection by immune cells. Overexpression of CD47 helps cancer cells avoid innate immune system detection by dendritic cells and subsequent antigen presentation to T cells, thereby limiting anti-tumor immune response. PD(L)-1 targeting immunotherapies are designed to reduce the suppression of T cells but do not address the initial evasion of the innate immune system by cancer cells. By removing the suppression of dendritic cells, CD47 blocking therapies in combination with PD(L)-1 targeted therapies can complement their T cell stimulatory activities. \\n\\n\\nLimitations of Current Approaches to Blocking CD47 \\n\\n\\nThere have been a number of approaches to blocking CD47, including monoclonal antibodies and fusion proteins that include an active Fc region.

Given that healthy blood cells express CD47, the presence of an “eat me” signal coupled with CD47 binding in a single-agent leads to destruction of blood cells. This mechanism is illustrated in the figure below. The trials of these other CD47 blocking agents have resulted in frequent occurrence of treatment-related cytopenias that we believe limits the therapeutic window of these agents. In addition to limiting the dosing, cytopenias can be dangerous for patients undergoing treatment for cancer as they may already have a compromised immune system related to intensive treatment regimens and disease progression.', metadata={'source': 'https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1810182/000156459022007364/0001564590-22-007364-index.htm', 'documentId': '0001564590-22-007364-item1-chunk0017'}),\n Document(page_content='▪\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLimited ability to combine with other anti-cancer agents\\n:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Combination therapies continue to play an important role in treating\\n \\npatients with cancer.

This fact, coupled with the high-affinity CD47 binding of our agent, results in enhanced phagocytosis from evorpacept in combination with other anti-cancer antibodies to a greater extent than other CD47 blockers. We believe this will allow us to explore evorpacept in combination with a higher number of leading anti-cancer antibodies compared to other CD47 blocking agents in both hematologic malignancies and solid tumors. In order to investigate the potential effects of the Fc domain and CD47 binding affinity on phagocytic activity, we produced two CD47 blocking agents with either an IgG4 or IgG1 active Fc domain, based on published sequences from two other clinical CD47 blockade programs. We combined these agents and evorpacept with cetuximab, an epidermal growth factor receptor, or EGFR, inhibitor that is the FDA approved for several solid tumors, to assess phagocytic activity as compared to single-agent cetuximab. Both cetuximab and the active Fc domain of a CD47 blocking agent bind to the same cell surface Fcγ receptors on a macrophage, potentially creating competition. IgG1 binds to receptors with higher affinity than IgG4 does, and evorpacept’s inactive Fc does not bind. This experiment shows that CD47 blocking agents with active Fc domains and lower affinity, combined with cetuximab result in lower phagocytic activity from macrophages as compared to evorpacept with cetuximab.

A clinical complete response comprises normalizing peripheral blood counts, resolution of bone marrow dysplasia and reduction in the percentage of immature blood cells, or myeloblasts, to less than 5%. CD47 blockade in combination with azacitidine has shown early clinical evidence that suggests it may improve CR rates in MDS.

There have been legislative and judicial efforts to repeal, replace, or change some or all of the ACA, including measures taken during the Trump administration.

Cancer cells leverage CD47, a cell surface protein, as a “don’t eat me” signal to evade detection by the immune system. Our company is developing a next-generation checkpoint inhibitor designed to have a high affinity for CD47 and to avoid the limitations caused by hematologic toxicities inherent in other CD47 blocking approaches. We believe our lead product candidate, evorpacept will have a wide therapeutic window to block the “don’t eat me” signal on cancer cells, and will leverage the immune activation of broadly used anti-cancer agents through combination strategies. As of December 31, 2021, we had dosed over 185 subjects with evorpacept across a range of hematologic and solid malignancies in combination with a number of leading anti-cancer agents. We plan to initiate additional studies in combination with leading anti-cancer agents. In solid tumors, we have initiated two randomized Phase 2 trials of evorpacept for the treatment of first-line advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, or HNSCC, and enrolled the first subject in the first trial in May 2021 and enrolled the first subject in the second trial in July 2021. Our collaborator, Zymeworks, also initiated a Phase 1 trial for the treatment of advanced HER2-expressing breast cancer and enrolled the first subject in October 2021.

Report\\nParent Company Liquidity\\nThe following discussion is included as a useful measure of the liquidity available to The AES Corporation, or the Parent Company, given the non-recourse nature of most of our indebtedness. Parent Company Liquidity as outlined below is a non-GAAP measure and should not be construed as an alternative to \\nCash and cash equivalents,\\n which is determined in accordance with GAAP. Parent Company Liquidity may differ from similarly titled measures used by other companies. The principal sources of liquidity at the Parent Company level are dividends and other distributions from our subsidiaries, including refinancing proceeds, proceeds from debt and equity financings at the Parent Company level, including availability under our revolving credit facility, and proceeds from asset sales. Cash requirements at the Parent Company level are primarily to fund interest and principal repayments of debt, construction commitments, other equity commitments, common stock repurchases, acquisitions, taxes, Parent Company overhead and development costs, and dividends on common stock.\\nThe Company defines Parent Company Liquidity as cash available to the Parent Company, including cash at qualified holding companies, plus available borrowings under our existing credit facility. The cash held at qualified holding companies represents cash sent to subsidiaries of the Company domiciled outside of the U.S. Such subsidiaries have no contractual restrictions on their ability to send cash to the Parent Company. Parent Company Liquidity is reconciled to its most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, \\nCash and cash equivalents\\n, at the periods indicated as follows (in millions):\\nDecember 31, 2021\\nDecember 31, 2020\\nConsolidated cash and cash equivalents\\n$\\n943\\xa0\\n$\\n1,089\\xa0\\nLess: Cash and cash equivalents at subsidiaries\\n(902)\\n(1,018)\\nParent Company and qualified holding companies' cash and cash equivalents\\n41\\xa0\\n71\", metadata={'source': 'https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/874761/000087476122000022/0000874761-22-000022-index.htm', 'documentId': '0000874761-22-000022-item1-chunk0008'}),\n Document(page_content=\"Consolidated cash and cash equivalents\\n$\\n943\\xa0\\n$\\n1,089\\xa0\\nLess: Cash and cash equivalents at subsidiaries\\n(902)\\n(1,018)\\nParent Company and qualified holding companies' cash and cash equivalents\\n41\\xa0\\n71\\xa0\\nCommitments under the Parent Company credit facility\\n1,250\\xa0\\n1,000\\xa0\\nLess: Letters of credit under the credit facility\\n(48)\\n(77)\\nLess: Borrowings under the credit facility\\n(365)\\n(70)\\nBorrowings available under the Parent Company credit facility\\n837\\xa0\\n853\\xa0\\nTotal Parent Company Liquidity\\n$\\n878\\xa0\\n$\\n924\\xa0\\nThe Parent Company paid dividends of $0.60 per outstanding share to its common stockholders during the year ended December 31, 2021.

This belief is based on a number of material assumptions, including, without limitation, assumptions about our ability to access the capital markets, the operating and financial performance of our subsidiaries, currency exchange rates, power market pool prices, and the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends. In addition, our subsidiaries' ability to declare and pay cash dividends to us (at the Parent Company level) is subject to certain limitations contained in loans, governmental provisions and other agreements. We can provide no assurance that these sources will be available when needed or that the actual cash requirements will not be greater than anticipated. We have met our interim needs for shorter-term and working capital financing at the Parent Company level with our revolving credit facility. See Item\\xa01A.—\\nRisk Factors\\n—\\nThe AES Corporation's ability to make payments on its outstanding indebtedness is dependent upon the receipt of funds from our subsidiaries,\\n of this Form 10-K.\\nVarious debt instruments at the Parent Company level, including our revolving credit facility, contain certain restrictive covenants.

As of December\\xa031, 2021, we were in compliance with these covenants at the Parent Company level.\\nNon-Recourse Debt\\nWhile the lenders under our non-recourse debt financings generally do not have direct recourse to the Parent Company, defaults thereunder can still have important consequences for our results of operations and liquidity, including, without limitation:\\n114 | 2021 Annual Report\\n•\", metadata={'source': 'https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/874761/000087476122000022/0000874761-22-000022-index.htm', 'documentId': '0000874761-22-000022-item1-chunk0010'}),\n Document(page_content='114 | 2021 Annual Report\\n•\\nreducing our cash flows as the subsidiary will typically be prohibited from distributing cash to the Parent Company during the time period of any default;\\n•\\ntriggering our obligation to make payments under any financial guarantee, letter of credit or other credit support we have provided to or on behalf of such subsidiary;\\n•\\ncausing us to record a loss in the event the lender forecloses on the assets; and\\n•\\ntriggering defaults in our outstanding debt at the Parent Company.\\nFor example, our revolving credit facility and outstanding debt securities at the Parent Company include events of default for certain bankruptcy-related events involving material subsidiaries.

The total non-recourse debt classified as current in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets amounts to $1.4 billion. The portion of current debt related to such defaults was $237 million at December 31, 2021, all of which was non-recourse debt related to three subsidiaries — AES Puerto Rico, AES Ilumina, and AES Jordan Solar. None of the defaults are payment defaults, but are instead technical defaults triggered by failure to comply with other covenants or other conditions contained in the non-recourse debt documents, of which $230 million is due to the bankruptcy of the offtaker.

However, as a result of additional dispositions of assets, other significant reductions in asset carrying values or other matters in the future that may impact our financial position and results of operations or the financial position of the individual subsidiary, it is possible that one or more of these subsidiaries could fall within the definition of a \"material subsidiary\" and thereby trigger an event of default and possible acceleration of the indebtedness under the Parent Company\\'s outstanding debt securities.

AES' significant accounting policies are described in Note\\xa01—\\nGeneral and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\\n to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item\\xa08.—\\nFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\\n of this Form\\xa010-K.\\nAn accounting estimate is considered critical if the estimate requires management to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the estimate was made, different estimates reasonably could have been used, or the impact of the estimates and assumptions on financial condition or operating performance is material.\", metadata={'source': 'https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/874761/000087476122000022/0000874761-22-000022-index.htm', 'documentId': '0000874761-22-000022-item1-chunk0015'}),\n Document(page_content=\"Management believes that the accounting estimates employed are appropriate and the resulting balances are reasonable; however, actual results could materially differ from the original estimates, requiring adjustments to these balances in future periods. Management has discussed these critical accounting policies with the Audit Committee, as appropriate. Listed below are the Company's most significant critical accounting estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements.\\nIncome Taxes\\n \\n— We are subject to income taxes in both the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Our worldwide income tax provision requires significant judgment and is based on calculations and assumptions that are subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service and other taxing authorities. Certain of the Company's subsidiaries are under examination by relevant taxing authorities for various tax years. The Company regularly assesses the potential outcome of these examinations in each tax jurisdiction when determining the adequacy of the provision for income taxes. Accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes prescribes a more likely than not recognition threshold. Tax reserves have been established, which the Company believes to be adequate in relation to the potential for additional assessments. Once established, reserves are adjusted only when there is more information available or when an event occurs necessitating a change to the reserves. While the Company believes that the amounts of the tax estimates are reasonable, it is possible that the ultimate outcome of current or future examinations may be materially different than the reserve amounts.\", metadata={'source': 'https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/874761/000087476122000022/0000874761-22-000022-index.htm', 'documentId': '0000874761-22-000022-item1-chunk0016'}),\n Document(page_content='Because we have a wide range of statutory tax rates in the multiple jurisdictions in which we operate, any changes in our geographical earnings mix could materially impact our effective tax rate. Furthermore, our tax position could be adversely impacted by changes in tax laws, tax treaties or tax regulations, or the interpretation or \\n116 | 2021 Annual Report\\nenforcement thereof and such changes may be more likely or become more likely in view of recent economic trends in certain of the jurisdictions in which we operate.\\nIn addition, no taxes have been recorded on undistributed earnings for certain of our non-U.S. subsidiaries to the extent such earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested in the operations of those subsidiaries. Should the earnings be remitted as dividends, the Company may be subject to additional foreign withholding and state income taxes.\\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of the existing assets and liabilities, and their respective income tax bases. The Company establishes a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. The Company has elected to treat GILTI as an expense in the period in which the tax is accrued. Accordingly, no deferred tax assets or liabilities are recorded related to GILTI.\\nImpairments\\n \\n— Our accounting policies on goodwill and long-lived assets are described in detail in Note 1—\\nGeneral and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies', metadata={'source': 'https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/874761/000087476122000022/0000874761-22-000022-index.htm', 'documentId': '0000874761-22-000022-item1-chunk0017'}),\n Document(page_content='Impairments\\n \\n— Our accounting policies on goodwill and long-lived assets are described in detail in Note 1—\\nGeneral and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\\n, included in Item\\xa08 of this Form 10-K. The Company makes considerable judgments in its impairment evaluations of goodwill and long-lived assets, starting with determining if an impairment indicator exists. Events that may result in an impairment analysis being performed include, but are not limited to: adverse changes in the regulatory environment, unfavorable changes in power prices or fuel costs, increased competition due to additional capacity in the grid, technological advancements, declining trends in demand, evolving industry expectations to transition away from fossil fuel sources for generation, or an expectation it is more likely than not that the asset will be disposed of before the end of its previously estimated useful life. The Company exercises judgment in determining if these events represent an impairment indicator requiring the computation of the fair value of goodwill and/or the recoverability of long-lived assets. The fair value determination is typically the most judgmental part in an impairment evaluation. Please see \\nFair Value\\n below for further detail.\\nAs part of the impairment evaluation process, management analyzes the sensitivity of fair value to various underlying assumptions. The level of scrutiny increases as the gap between fair value and carrying amount decreases. Changes in any of these assumptions could result in management reaching a different conclusion regarding the potential impairment, which could be material. Our impairment evaluations inherently involve uncertainties from uncontrollable events that could positively or negatively impact the anticipated future economic and operating conditions.\\nFurther discussion of the impairment charges recognized by the Company can be found within Note 9—\\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\\n \\nand Note 22—', metadata={'source': 'https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/874761/000087476122000022/0000874761-22-000022-index.htm', 'documentId': '0000874761-22-000022-item1-chunk0018'}),\n Document(page_content='Further discussion of the impairment charges recognized by the Company can be found within Note 9—\\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\\n \\nand Note 22—\\nAsset Impairment Expense\\n to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item\\xa08 of this Form 10-K.\\nDepreciation\\n \\n— Depreciation, after consideration of salvage value and asset retirement obligations, is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which are determined on a composite or component basis. The Company considers many factors in its estimate of useful lives, including expected usage, physical deterioration, technological changes, existence and length of off-taker agreements, and laws and regulations, among others. In certain circumstances, these estimates involve significant judgment and require management to forecast the impact of relevant factors over an extended time horizon. \\nUseful life estimates are continually evaluated for appropriateness as changes in the relevant factors arise, including when a long-lived asset group is tested for recoverability. Depreciation studies are performed periodically for assets subject to composite depreciation. Any change to useful lives is considered a change in accounting estimate and is made on a prospective basis.\\nFair Value \\n— For information regarding the fair value hierarchy, see Note\\xa01—\\nGeneral and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\\n included in Item\\xa08 of this Form\\xa010-K.\\nFair Value of Financial Instruments', metadata={'source': 'https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/874761/000087476122000022/0000874761-22-000022-index.htm', 'documentId': '0000874761-22-000022-item1-chunk0019'}),\n Document(page_content='— For information regarding the fair value hierarchy, see Note\\xa01—\\nGeneral and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\\n included in Item\\xa08 of this Form\\xa010-K.\\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\\n \\n— A significant number of the Company\\'s financial instruments are carried at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in earnings or other comprehensive income each period. Investments are generally fair valued based on quoted market prices or other observable market data such as interest rate indices. The Company\\'s investments are primarily certificates of deposit and mutual funds. Derivatives are valued using observable data as inputs into internal valuation models. The Company\\'s derivatives primarily consist of interest rate swaps, foreign currency instruments, and commodity and embedded derivatives. Additional \\n117 | 2021 Annual Report\\ndiscussion regarding the nature of these financial instruments and valuation techniques can be found in Note\\xa05—\\nFair Value\\n included in Item\\xa08 of this Form 10-K.\\nFair Value of Nonfinancial Assets and Liabilities\\n \\n— Significant estimates are made in determining the fair value of long-lived tangible and intangible assets (i.e., property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and goodwill) during the impairment evaluation process. In addition, the majority of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination and asset acquisitions by VIEs are required to be recognized at fair value under the relevant accounting guidance. \\nThe Company may engage an independent valuation firm to assist management with the valuation. The Company generally utilizes the income approach to value nonfinancial assets and liabilities, specifically a Discounted Cash Flow (\"DCF\") model to estimate fair value by discounting cash flow forecasts, adjusted to reflect market participant assumptions, to the extent necessary, at an appropriate discount rate.', metadata={'source': 'https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/874761/000087476122000022/0000874761-22-000022-index.htm', 'documentId': '0000874761-22-000022-item1-chunk0020'}),\n ...]"
